The GDI measures gender gaps in human development achievements by accounting for disparities between women and men in three basic dimensions of human development—health, knowledge and living standards using the same component indicators as in the HDI. The ratio is Female HDI:Male HDI. Values further from 1 have less development equality between genders.

name: Alerts for Price Spikes - WFP markets at alert level orange in 2014
description: This shows the number of markets at alert level orange from the WFP, in the year 2014. The current ALPS value for a food commodity is the number of standard deviations the current price is above the commodity's expected price for that month. Based on this ALPS value, markets are assigned to 1 of 4 situations, where all nominal values are measured in standard deviations from the seasonal mean price:     Normal (white), ALPS < 0.25  Stress (yellow), 0.25 < ALPS < 1  Alert (orange), 1 < ALPS < 2  Crisis (red), ALPS >= 2.

name: Average Annual Precipitation (1971_2000)
description: The NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset is comprised of downscaled climate scenarios for the globe that are derived from the General Circulation Model (GCM) runs conducted under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and across two of the four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The CMIP5 GCM runs were developed in support of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). The NEX-GDDP dataset includes downscaled projections for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 from the 21 models and scenarios for which daily scenarios were produced and distributed under CMIP5. Further information on the methodology can be found at https://nex.nasa.gov/nex/static/media/other/NEX-GDDP_Tech_Note_v1_08June2015.pdf.
