description: The Political Violence Risk Assessment data set was originally published by the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies (HCSS). Its purpose is to forcast the onset of large-scale political violence. Countries are evaluated to determine their "risk" of experiencing a large-scale political violence event in the next month using structural data (infant mortality, regime type, conflicts in neighboring countries, and state-led discrimination) and automated event data (protests, assaults, and expressions of disapproval) from the previous month, which are are combined in a logistic regression model. The score is normalized between 0 and 100 and indicates the percentile rank of probability of onset. Infant mortality data are from World Development Indicators; other structural data are from the Center for Systemic Peace; event data are from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone; and normalization and aggregation were done by the HCSS. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The Weekly Volcano Report, produced by the Smithsonian Institution and the USGS, displays activity from mostly terrestrial volcanoes that meet one of the following criteria: (1) a volcanic ash advisory has been released by a volcanic ash advisory center (VAAC) stating that an ash cloud has been produced from the volcano, (2) a verifiable news report of new activity or a change in activity at the volcano has been issued, and  (3) observers have reported a significant change in volcanic activity. This data set mostly excludes continuous eruptive activity and sea-floor volcanism. Volcanoes are included in the "New Activity/Unrest" section of the Weekly Volcanic Activity Report if the activity occurs after at least 3 months of quiescence. Once a volcano is included in the "New Activity/Unrest" section, updates will remain in that section unless the activity continues for more than 1 month without escalating, after which time updates will be listed in the "Continuing Activity" section. A volcano is also included in the "New Activity/Unrest" section if it is undergoing a period of relatively high unrest, or increasing unrest. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The Weekly Volcanic Activity Report is intended to provide timely information about global volcanism on a weekly basis. Consequently, the report is generated rapidly by summarizing volcanic reports from various sources, with little time for fact-checking. The accuracy of the Weekly Volcanic Activity Report is dependent upon the quality of the volcanic activity reports it receives. Reports published in the Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network are monthly, and more carefully reviewed, although all of the volcanoes discussed in the Weekly Volcanic Activity Reportare not necessarily reported in the Bulletin. Because of the Weekly Volcano Report's emphasis on rapid reporting on the web it has avoided diacritical marks. Reports are updated on the Weekly Volcanic Activity Report web page as they are received, therefore information may be included regarding events that occurred before the current report period.

description: The Tree Plantations data set was created by Transparent World, with the support of Global Forest Watch. Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru. Given the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily Landsat, supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size. Each polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A “gr” in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within a polygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows: (1) large industrial plantation: single plantation units larger than 100 ha; (2) mosaic of medium-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 100 ha embedded within patches of other land use; (3) mosaic of small-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 10 ha embedded within patches of other land use; (4) clearing/very young plantation: bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc.). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: An accuracy assessment found an overall accuracy of 87% in Malaysia. The accuracies of the species and type labels were not assessed. These fields represent the best guess of the analysts and should not be used for official purposes. Polygons labeled as clearings were bare or had very young vegetation as of 2013 or 2014, but contextual clues suggest that these areas will eventually become tree plantations.

description: “Managed forests” refers to areas allocated by a government for harvesting timber and other wood products in a public forest. Managed forests are distinct from wood fiber concessions, where tree plantations are established for the exclusive production of pulp and paper products. “Concession” is used as a general term for licenses, permits, or other contracts that confer rights to private companies to manage and extract timber and other wood products from public forests; terminology varies at the national level, however, and includes "forest permits," "tenures," "licenses," and other terms. This data set displays managed forest concessions as a single layer assembled by aggregating data for multiple countries. The data may come from government agencies, NGOs, or other organizations and varies by date and data sources. Gathered by the World Resources Institute (WRI), Managed Forest Concessions has varying temporal and geographic resolution within each of the nine countries. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: This dataset shows the modeled global patterns of above-ground biomass of mangrove forests. The dataset was developed by the Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, with support from The Nature Conservancy. The work is based on a review of 95 field studies on carbon storage and fluxes in mangroves world-wide. A climate-based model for potential mangrove above-ground biomass was developed, with almost four times the explanatory power of the only previous published model. The map highlights the high variability in mangrove above-ground biomass and indicates areas that could be prioritized for mangrove conservation and restoration. The underlying mangrove distribution map (vector) is taken from the World Mangrove Atlas (Spalding et al. 2010; WCMC-011). This dataset refers to above-ground forest biomass (in tonnes per hectare), rather than above-ground carbon. A calculation to convert forest biomass to carbon is provided in Hutchison et al. (2014), but this is based on limited data and is not site specific.
cautions: The model used to generate this data set predicts potential biomass rather than actual biomass. Where mangroves have been degraded, the model will not account for this. The model does not account for small-scale spatial variation, such as zonation within a mangrove area. It is based on the bioclimatic variables from Bioclim (Hijmans et al. 2005), which, although given as 30 arc second grids, are highly interpolated from individual weather stations. As such, it is not recommend that the layer be used in fine-scale analyses. The model is only for aboveground biomass. Hutchison et al. (2014) gives an allometric equation to convert this to living root biomass, but other mangrove carbon stores (notably soil carbon) are not covered. Some regions have large, multipart polygons. For example, all the mangroves of Colombia are grouped into a single polygon and therefore have a single value for total biomass and mean biomass per unit area. To see variation within these large polygons, it is possible to take data directly from the modeled raster layer (subject to the caveats mentioned about the scale at which the data can be sensibly used). These data represent carbon density values based on Hutchison et al. (2014). The Mangrove Forest layer displayed on Globalforestwatch.org website is based on Giri et al. (2011).

description: This data set, released by the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), shows of the global distribution of cold-water corals that inhabit the colder deep waters of continental shelves and offshore canyons, ranging from 50 to over 1000 m depths. They lack zooxanthellae and may build reef-like structures or occur solitarily. Occurrence records are given for the subclass Octocorallia (octocorals; also known as Alcyonaria) and four Orders (in Class Anthozoa): Scleractinia (reef-forming corals), Antipatharia (black corals), Zoanthidae (encrusting or button polyps), and Pennatulacea (sea pens). Occurrence records are also available for the order sub-Order Filifera (lace corals) in Class Hydrozoa. Depth range, including upper and lower depths, status of the sample, and reference to where the record was first published is also included.    This data set contains data for 132 countries and comprises 32,631 occurrences of cold corals, including locations within the high seas. Occurrence records were obtained from various sources, including reports, peer-reviewed articles and expert consultations. Many individuals and organizations contributed by providing UNEP-WCMC with their data in electronic form. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The high density of reefs shown in the North Atlantic most probably reflects the intensity of research in this region. Further discoveries are expected worldwide, particularly in the deeper waters of subtropical and tropical regions. Please note that taxonomic classifications change frequently.

description: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) team assembles its temperature analysis from publicly available data acquired by roughly 6,300 meteorological stations around the world; by ship- and buoy-based instruments measuring sea surface temperature; and by Antarctic research stations. These raw data are analyzed using methods that account for the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and for urban heating effects that could skew the calculations. There are sufficient observations from 1880 (particularly in the Southern Hemisphere) to produce a reasonably precise global temperature record. Prior to that, uncertainties (due to gaps in spatial coverage) increase substantially. This graph illustrates the change in global surface temperature relative to 1951-80 average temperatures. Sixteen of the 17 warmest years in the 136-year record all have occurred since 2001, with the exception of 1998. The year 2016 ranks as the warmest on record. This research is broadly consistent with similar constructions prepared by the Climatic Research Unit and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: To maximize the benefits of the different databases, while promoting completeness and accuracy, CAIT compiles data for CO₂ from fossil fuels with different data sources in order to make cross-country comparisons and offer related analyses. Yet comparability can be endangered when data points from different sources (using different methodologies) are placed side-by-side.

description: This chart defines the top 10 emitters based on their total annual emissions, also known as “absolute emissions.” Why? Over time, the absolute amount of GHGs emitted is what ultimately affects atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and the global carbon budget (see cumulative emissions, below). So the largest absolute emitters today have a larger role to play in determining the climate of the future. Regardless of other factors, these total annual numbers will have to be reduced for the top 10 emitters if global warming is to be limited to 2 degrees C.

A country's ND-GAIN score is composed of a vulnerability score and a readiness score. Vulnerability and readiness are based on compiled indicators. Vulnerability measures a country's exposure, sensitivity, and capacity to adapt to the negative effects of climate change. ND-GAIN measures overall vulnerability by considering 6 life-supporting sectors---food, water, health, ecosystem service, human habitat, and infrastructure---and 36 indicators. Readiness measures a country's ability to leverage investments and convert them to adaptation actions. ND-GAIN measures overall readiness by considering 3 components---economic readiness, governance readiness, and social readiness---and 9 indicators. Each indicator comes from a public data source. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The Ecological Footprint of Consumption data set, released by the Global Footprint Network, is derived by tracking how much biologically productive area is required by an ecosystem to absorb a population's carbon dioxide emissions and to regenerate all the biological resources humans consume. Biologically productive area is measured in global hectares, a value based on world productivity across all ecosystem types. Because world productivity varies slightly from year to year, the value of a global hectare may change slightly from year to year. To calculate a nation's ecological footprint, this data set uses yields of primary products (from cropland, forest, grazing land and fisheries), both imports and exports, to calculate the area necessary to support a population's production. The total footprint (EFC) is then calculated by adding area for imports (EFI) to and subtracting area for exports (EFE) from the area for the national production (EFP). In other words, EFC = EFP + EFI - EFE. The per capita rate is calculated by dividing the total footprint by the total population of the nation. Thus, a nation with a large consumption rate relative to its area, or one which imports more than it exports, will have a high ecological footprint. For global consumption to remain sustainable, combined ecological footprints across countries should not exceed the total global hectares of biologically productive land and water. For instance, in 2013 there were approximately 12 billion global hectares, and 7 billion people alive that year, for an average of 1.72 global hectares per person. The data set includes more than 200 countries, territories, and regions from 1961 to 2013, based on approximately 15,000 data points per country per year. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The quality, reliability, and validity of the NFAs (National Footprint Accounts) are dependent upon the level of accuracy and availability of a wide range of data sets, many of which have incomplete coverage, and most of which do not specify confidence limits. The Ecological Footprint is underestimated as it does not track freshwater consumption, soil erosion, GHGs emissions other than CO₂, or impacts for which no regenerative capacity exists (pollution in terms of waste generation, toxicity, eutrophication, etc.). Because world productivity varies slightly from year to year, the value of a global hectare may change slightly from year to year. Regeneration capacity is measured under current management schemes and extraction technologies, and can change from year to year due to climate, management, and the proportion considered useful to the human economy.

description: The foreign direct investment (FDI) Regulatory Restrictiveness Index, released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), measures the restrictiveness of a country’s foreign direct investment (FDI) rules by looking at the four main types of restrictions: 1) foreign equity limitations; 2) discriminatory screening or approval mechanisms; 3) restrictions on the employment of foreigners as key personnel; and 4) other operational restrictions, e.g. restrictions on branching and on capital repatriation or on land ownership by foreign-owned enterprises. Restrictions are evaluated on a 0 (no restrictions) to 1 (full restrictions) scale. Each restriction will be given a score based on an assessment of its importance. The overall restrictiveness index is the weighted average of sectoral scores. The discriminatory nature of measures, i.e. when they apply to foreign investors only, is the central criterion for scoring a measure. State ownership and state monopolies, to the extent they are not discriminatory towards foreigners, are not scored. This data set contains 62 countries across 22 sectors and is currently available for the following years: 1997, 2003, 2006, 2010-2016. For OECD and non-OECD countries adherents to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises, information is collected based on countries’ lists of exceptions to National Treatment. For the non-OECD countries, information is collected through Investment Policy Reviews. Information is updated on a yearly basis following the OECD Freedom of Investment monitoring of investment measures. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The FDI Index is not a full measure of a country’s investment climate. A range of other factors come into play, including how FDI rules are implemented. Entry barriers can also arise for other reasons, including state ownership in key sectors. A country’s ability to attract FDI will be affected by others factors such as the size of its market, the extent of its integration with neighbors and even its geography. Nonetheless, FDI rules can be a critical determinant for a country’s attractiveness to foreign investors.

description: The Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT) Emissions Projections is part of the larger CAIT Climate Data Explorer. CAIT is a suite of online data and visualization tools that support the many dimensions of climate policy making. It provides free, open, user-friendly access to world-class climate data. The projections tool allows users to view projected emissions from national and international sources and compare policy assumptions and drivers between countries, and among sources. The tool aims to increase the transparency of each scenario by publishing key assumptions and other related information. The CAIT Emissions Projections tool collates emission projections for major emitters through the year 2100, or earlier if limited data are available. Each data subset, such as GHG Emissions Data or Socioeconomic Data, has indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product or Population, that influence the projection. Predictions are created through scenarios. These describe possible future pathways under existing policies and actions, or, in other words, in the absence of further mitigation efforts. CAIT draws on key climate-relevant data from respected research centers, government agencies, and international bodies. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Projection data should be used with caution. Socioeconomic and policy assumptions have been made for scenarios used in these data. None of these scenarios take into account long-term climate stabilization targets.

description: The traffic deaths rate data produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) give mortality data from road traffic injuries. To estimate road traffic fatal injury, countries were classified into 4 groups as follows: 1) Countries with death registration data completeness of at least 80%. For this category, one of the following data points was used: death registration, projection of the most recent death registration, reported death, or projected reported deaths. 2) Countries with other sources of information on cause of death. This group includes India, Iran, Thailand, and Vietnam. For these countries, a regression method was used to project forward the most recent year for which an estimate of total road traffic deaths was available. 3) Countries with population less than 150,000 and without eligible death registration data. For these countries, the deaths reported in the survey were used directly, without adjustment. 4) Countries without eligible death registration data. For these countries, a negative binomial regression model was used.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Most countries do not have robust reporting systems: in 2009, only 34 countries produced high-quality cause-of-death data, 85 countries produced lower-quality data, and 74 countries produced none.

description: The Access to Improved Sanitation Facilities data set, derived by the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), is the percentage of the national population (rual, urban and total) using improved sanitation facilities for more than 200 countries from 1990 to 2015. Improved sanitation facilities are likely to ensure hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact, and range from simple but protected pit latrines to flush toilets with a sewerage connection. To be effective, facilities must be correctly constructed and properly maintained. The data set is created based on national censuses and nationally representative household surveys. The coverage rates for sanitation are based on information from service users on the facilities their households actually use rather than on information from service providers, which may include nonfunctioning systems. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Years vary based on survey coverage and the data for this indicator have not been updated since 2015.

description: The rate of out-of-school children, generated by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, is the percentage of children not in school by year per country. The data extend back to 1999. UIS gathers these statistics using questionnaires, which are sent to UNESCO Member States annually. The questionnaires are based on international standards, classifications, and measures that are regularly reviewed and modified by the IS in order to address emerging statistical issues and improve the quality of data. UIS collaborates with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Eurostat to collect data with surveys (collectively UOE). The UOE questionnaire compiles data from high- and middle-income countries that are members or partner countries of the OECD or Eurostat. The UOE survey gathers more detailed education statistics. Midyear population estimates for countries with at least 90,000 inhabitants are provided by the United Nations Population Division to calculate the percentages.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Education statistics are self-reported by country and may be inaccurate or missing data. Population data for countries between 50,000 and 90,000 inhabitants were not available in the 2015 Revision of the World Population Prospects and are therefore based on the 2012 Revision. Where UN Population Division estimates are not available, or where population issues have arisen, national data or UIS estimates are used.

description: Life expectancy at birth is derived from male and female life expectancy at birth and compiled by the World Bank from sources such as 1) United Nations Population Division: World Population Prospects; 2) Census reports and other statistical publications from national statistical offices; 3) Eurostat: Demographic Statistics; 4) United Nations Statistical Division: Population and Vital Statistics Report (various years); 5) U.S. Census Bureau: International Database; and 6) Secretariat of the Pacific Community: Statistics and Demography. It is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality patterns at the time of its birth remain constant in the future. It reflects the overall mortality level of a population and summarizes the mortality pattern that prevails across all age groups in a given year. It is calculated in a period life table, which provides a snapshot of a population's mortality pattern at a given time. It therefore does not reflect the mortality pattern that a person actually experiences during his or her life, which can be calculated in a cohort life table. High mortality in young age groups significantly lowers the life expectancy at birth. But if a person survives his or her childhood of high mortality, he or she may live much longer. For example, in a population with a life expectancy at birth of 50, there may be few people dying at age 50. The life expectancy at birth may be low due to high childhood mortality, so that once a person survives his or her childhood, he or she may live much longer than 50 years. This data set of country-level figures is global in scope and spans 1960-2015. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.

description: The Worldwide Governance Indicators, produced by the World Bank project, report aggregate and individual governance indicators for over 200 countries and territories over the period 1996–2015 for 6 dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption. These aggregate indicators combine the views of a large number of enterprise, citizen, and expert-survey respondents in industrial and developing countries. They are based on over 30 individual data sources produced by a variety of survey institutes, think tanks, nongovernmental organizations, international organizations, and private sector firms. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Changes in governance over short year-to-year periods are difficult to measure with any kind of data, and are typically quite small. Recognizing this, users of the WGI should in most cases not focus on short-run year-to-year changes but rather on trends over longer periods. As with comparisons across countries, comparisons of governance scores for one country over time need to take into account margins of error: if confidence intervals for governance estimates in two periods overlap, the WGI data should not be interpreted as signaling meaningful changes in governance. The vast majority of year-to-year changes in the WGI are too small relative to margins of error to be viewed as statistically, or practically, significant and so should not be overinterpreted as indicating a significant change in governance performance.

description: The GINI index, released by the World Bank, measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The GINI index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a GINI index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality. The World Bank’s internationally comparable poverty monitoring database now draws on income or detailed consumption data from more than 1,000 household surveys across 138 countries in 6 regions and 21 other high-income countries (industrialized economies) from 1990 to 2014. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: GINI coefficients are not unique. It is possible for 2 different Lorenz curves to give rise to the same GINI coefficient. Furthermore it is possible for the GINI coefficient of a developing country to rise (due to increasing inequality of income) while the number of people in absolute poverty decreases. This is because the GINI coefficient measures relative, not absolute, wealth. Another limitation of the GINI coefficient is that it is not additive across groups, i.e., the total GINI of a society is not equal to the sum of the GINI for its subgroups. Thus country-level GINI coefficients cannot be aggregated into regional or global GINIs, although a GINI coefficient can be computed for the aggregate. Because the underlying household surveys differ in methods and types of welfare measures collected, data are not strictly comparable across countries or even across years within a country. Two sources of noncomparability should be noted for distributions of income in particular. First, the surveys can differ in many respects, including whether they use income or consumption expenditure as the living standard indicator. The distribution of income is typically more unequal than the distribution of consumption. In addition, the definitions of income used differ more often among surveys. Consumption is usually a much better welfare indicator, particularly in developing countries. Second, households differ in size (number of members) and in the extent of income sharing among members. And individuals differ in age and consumption needs. Differences among countries in these respects may bias comparisons of distribution. World Bank staff have made an effort to ensure that the data are as comparable as possible. Wherever possible, consumption has been used rather than income. Income distribution and GINI indexes for high-income economies are calculated directly from the Luxembourg Income Study database, using an estimation method consistent with that applied for developing countries.

description: The UNESCO Institute for Statistics compiled statistics on global adult literacy based on national censuses and household surveys and, for countries without recent literacy data, using the Global Age-Specific Literacy Projection Model (GALP). Literacy rates are outcome indicators to evaluate educational attainment. These data can predict the quality of future labor force and can be used in ensuring policies for life skills for men and women. They can be also used as a proxy instrument to see the effectiveness of education system: a high literacy rate suggests the capacity of an education system to provide a large population with opportunities to acquire literacy skills. The accumulated achievement of education is fundamental for further intellectual growth and social and economic development, although it doesn't necessarily ensure the quality of education. Literacy statistics for most countries cover the population ages 15 and older, but some include younger ages or are confined to age ranges that tend to inflate literacy rates. Generally, literacy also encompasses numeracy, or the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations. The reference period for aggregates is 1985-1994 for 1990, 1995-2004 for 2000, and 2005-2014 for 2010.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: In practice, literacy is difficult to measure. Estimating literacy rates requires census or survey measurements under controlled conditions. Many countries report the number of literate people from self-reported data. Some use educational attainment data as a proxy but apply different lengths of school attendance or levels of completion, and there is a trend among recent national and international surveys toward using a direct reading test of literacy skills. Because definitions and methods of data collection differ across countries, data should be used cautiously.

description: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) compiles the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) as part of its Human Development Report initiative. First published in 2010, the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) identifies multiple deprivations at the household and individual level in health, education and standard of living. It uses micro data from household surveys, and—unlike the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index—all the indicators needed to construct the measure must come from the same survey. Each person in a given household is classified as poor or non-poor depending on the weighted number of deprivations his or her household experiences. These data are then aggregated into the national measure of poverty. The MPI reflects both the prevalence of multidimensional deprivation and its intensity-the percentage of simultaneous deprivations poor people experience. It can be used to create a comprehensive picture of people living in poverty, and permits comparisons both across countries, regions and the world and within countries by ethnic group, urban or rural location, as well as other key household and community characteristics. The MPI offers a valuable complement to income-based poverty measures. Indicators shown in the MPI include the following: 1) health: nutrition and child mortality; 2) education: years of schooling and children enrolled; and 3) standard of living: cooking fuel, toilet, water, electricity, floor, and assets. The MPI is calculated by multiplying the incidence of poverty by the intensity of poverty. The incidence of poverty is the proportion of people considered to experience multidimensional poverty, i.e., that are considered deprived in at least one third of the MPI's weighted indicators. The intensity of multidimensional poverty is the weighted average number of deprivations poor people experience at the same time. The main data sources of the MPI are the Macro Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of the Inner City Fund (ICF) and the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS) of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The 2016 Human Development Report (HDR) presents estimates for 102 developing countries with a combined population of 5.2 billion (72% of the world total). About 1.5 billion people in the countries covered—29% of their entire population—lived in multidimensional poverty between 2005 and 2015. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The MPI has some drawbacks, due mainly to data constraints. First, the indicators include both outputs (such as years of schooling) and inputs (such as cooking fuel) as well as one stock indicator (child mortality). Second, the health data are relatively weak and overlook some groups’ deprivations especially for nutrition, though the patterns that emerge are plausible and familiar. Third, in some cases careful judgments were needed to address missing data. But to be considered multidimensionally poor, households must be deprived in at least six standard of living indicators or in three standard of living indicators and one health or education indicator. This requirement makes the MPI less sensitive to minor inaccuracies. Fourth, intra-household inequalities may be severe, but these could not be reflected. Fifth, while the MPI goes well beyond a headcount to include the intensity of poverty experienced, it does not measure inequality among the poor, although decompositions by groups can be used to reveal group-based inequalities. Finally, the estimates presented here are based on publicly available data and cover various years between 2005 and 2015, which limits direct cross-country comparability.

description: The Human Development Index (HDI), published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, a sufficient education, and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the 3 dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth; the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school-entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing gross national income (GNI). The scores for the 3 HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. The HDI is calculated for 188 countries annually.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The HDI simplifies and captures only part of what human development entails. It does not reflect on inequalities, poverty, human security, empowerment, etc.

description: The Agriculture, Value Added data set was created by the World Bank and displays the net output of agriculture sectors in most countries and various other regional entities (e.g. geographic regions, economic output, members of certain economic/political unions) after adding up all outputs and subtracting the value of intermediate goods and services consumed in production. Agriculture corresponds to International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) divisions 1-5 and includes forestry, hunting, and fishing, as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. The value added is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. The origin of value added is determined by the ISIC, revision 3. National data are available for some countries beginning in 1960 and available for an increasing number of countries up until 2016, when all but a few countries are represented. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Among the difficulties faced by compilers of national accounts is the extent of unreported economic activity in the informal or secondary economy. In developing countries a large share of agricultural output is either not exchanged (because it is consumed within the household) or not exchanged for money. Agricultural production often must be estimated indirectly, using a combination of methods involving estimates of inputs, yields, and area under cultivation. This approach sometimes leads to crude approximations that can differ from the true values over time and across crops for reasons other than climate conditions or farming techniques. Similarly, agricultural inputs that cannot easily be allocated to specific outputs are frequently "netted out" using equally crude and ad hoc approximations.

Data on global sea surface anomaly predictions according to various RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) scenarios are combined with various socioeconomic data sets that illustrate the sensitivity of countries' fisheries (i.e., number of fishers, fisheries export as percentage of total, proportion of the economically active population (EAP) working as fishers, total fisheries landings, nutritional dependence) and overall adaptive capacity of the country's population/government/fishing industry (i.e., healthy life expectancy, literacy rate + school enrollment, governance, GDP per capita, subsidies per landed monetary volume, proportion of industrial to small-scale fisheries) to determine the overall vulnerability of national fisheries. 147 coastal countries have an index score for different scenarios for 2016 to 2050 and 2066 to 2100. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) created the 2017 Global Hunger Index (GHI) to highlight successes and failures in hunger reduction, and provide insights into the drivers of hunger. By raising awareness and understanding of regional and country differences in hunger, the GHI aims to trigger actions to reduce hunger. Hunger is defined as the distress associated with lack of food. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) defines food deprivation, or undernourishment, as the consumption of food that is not sufficient to provide the minimum amount of dietary energy that each individual requires to live a healthy and productive life, given his or her sex, age, stature, and physical activity level. The GHI is built on several national-level statistics sourced from the FAO, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank Group, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and when necessary the authors' estimates. The GHI uses 4 indicators: 1) the proportion of undernourished in the population (%); 2) the prevalence of wasting in children under 5 years (%); 3) the prevalence of stunting in children under 5 years (%); and 4) the under-5 mortality rate (%). Once obtained, values for each of these indicators are standardized. A weighted sum of these standardized values equals the GHI score. This calculation results in GHI scores on a 100-point scale where 0 is the best score (no hunger) and 100 the worst. In practice, neither of these extremes is reached. A value of 100 would signify that a country's undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality levels each exactly meet the thresholds set slightly above the highest levels observed worldwide in recent decades. A value of zero would mean that a country had no undernourished people in the population, no children younger than five who were wasted or stunted, and no children who died before their fifth birthday. Countries are classified according to their GHI scores as having low, moderate, serious, alarming, or extremely alarming issues related to hunger.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: GHI scores for 2017 could not be calculated for 13 countries because data on the prevalence of undernourishment and, in some cases, data or estimates on child stunting and child wasting were unavailable. Yet the countries with missing data may be the ones suffering most. Therefore, we still review the hunger and undernutrition situations in such places. To monitor and evaluate progress, it is essential that the national governments of these countries, along with the appropriate international organizations, take all steps necessary to make the missing data available without delay. Only when the extent of the problem is known can it effectively be tackled.

description: The World Bank Group International Comparison Program compiles gross domestic product (GDP) data based on purchasing power parity (PPP) converted to international dollars by country. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States.  GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current international dollars. For most economies PPP figures are extrapolated from the 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP) benchmark estimates or imputed using a statistical model based on the 2011 ICP. For 47 high- and upper middle-income economies conversion factors are provided by Eurostat and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).   Because exchange rates do not always reflect differences in price levels between countries, GDP and GDP per capita estimates are converted into international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. PPP rates provide a standard measure allowing comparison of real levels of expenditure between countries, just as conventional price indexes allow comparison of real values over time. PPP rates are calculated by simultaneously comparing the prices of similar goods and services among a large number of countries. In the most recent round of price surveys conducted by the International Comparison Program (ICP) in 2011, 199 economies participated. The PPP conversion factors come from three sources. For 47 high- and upper middle-income countries conversion factors are provided by Eurostat and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). For the remaining 2011 ICP countries the PPP estimates are extrapolated from the 2011 ICP benchmark results, which account for relative price changes between each economy and the United States. For countries that did not participate in the 2011 ICP round, the PPP estimates are imputed using a statistical model. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.

description: Population Living in Slums, created by the World Bank (WBG) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), is the proportion of the urban population living in slum households. A slum household is defined as a group of individuals living under the same roof lacking one or more of the following conditions: access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, sufficient living area, and durability of housing. This was a metric to measure target 7.D of the Millenium Development Goals. The actual proportion of people living in slums is measured by a proxy, represented by the urban population living in households with at least one of the four characteristics: (a) lack of access to improved water supply; (b) lack of access to improved sanitation; (c) overcrowding (3 or more persons per room); and (d) dwellings made of non-durable material. Data are collected globally from 1990, 2000, 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2014. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The indicator does not cover the spatial dimension of slums. As the indicator cannot take into account how many and to which extent the 5 conditions of deprived housing are fulfilled, it cannot provide information on the severity of slum conditions.

description: The Urban Population data, released by the United Nations Population Division and distributed by the World Bank Group, refer to people around the world living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. The indicator is calculated using World Bank population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects from 1960 through 2016. Percentages urban are the numbers of persons residing in an area defined as ''urban'' per 100 total population. They are calculated by the Statistics Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Particular caution should be used in interpreting the figures for percentage urban for different countries. Countries differ in the way they classify population as "urban" or "rural." The population of a city or metropolitan area depends on the boundaries chosen. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Aggregation of urban and rural population may not add up to total population because of different country coverage. There is no consistent and universally accepted standard for distinguishing urban from rural areas, in part because of the wide variety of situations across countries. Most countries use an urban classification related to the size or characteristics of settlements. Some define urban areas based on the presence of certain infrastructure and services. And other countries designate urban areas based on administrative arrangements. Because of national differences in the characteristics that distinguish urban from rural areas, the distinction between urban and rural population is not amenable to a single definition that would apply to all countries. Estimates of the world's urban population would change significantly if China, India, and a few other populous nations were to change their definition of urban centers. Because the estimates of city and metropolitan area are based on national definitions of what constitutes a city or metropolitan area, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution.

description: The access-to-electricity data are released through the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) database and collected among different sources: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMSs), Multi-indicator Cluster Surveys (MICSs), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, and various government agencies (e.g., ministries of energy and utilities). Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points: around 1990, around 2000, and around 2010. Therefore, a country can have a continuum of 0 to 3 data points. There are 42 countries with 0 data points, and the weighted regional average was used as an estimate for electrification in each of the data periods. 170 countries have between 1 and 3 data points, and missing data are estimated by using a model with region, country, and time variables. The model keeps the original observation if data are available for any of the time periods. This modeling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these 3 time periods (indicated as "Estimate"). The notation "Assumption" refers to the assumption of universal access in countries classified as developed by the United Nations. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The most comprehensive database on global material extraction currently available, covering nearly 300 different raw materials for the time period of 1970 to 2015, made available in a detail of 13 aggregated material categories. Data from this database are used by academics around the world, integrated into several multi-regional input-output databases such as EXIOBASE and WIOD and regularly featured in reports by international organisations, such as UNEP, OECD and the EEA.  Database on national raw material extraction, provided by the UN Environment International Resource Panel (IRP) and developed as part of a collaborative effort by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia, the research group Sustainable Resource Use of the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU), Austria, the Institute of Social Ecology Vienna (SEC), Austria, the University of Nagoya, Japan, and University of Sydney’s Integrated Sustainability Analysis (ISA), Australia.  Included in Resource Watch are data reflecting the Domestic Extraction (DE) and Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) of global countries. Domestic Extraction measures the total amount of raw materials extracted (e.g. mined, harvested, drilled) within a country, measured in mass units; and Domestic Material Consumption measures the sum of Domestic Extraction and direct imports of raw materials minus the direct exports. DMC measures the total amount of material directly used in an economy. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The included data on indicators Raw Material Consumption, Raw Material Consumption per capita, Raw Material Inputs, Raw Material Equivalents of imports, Raw Material Equivalents of exports are not part of the official dataset, but additionally provided from own calculations by WU Vienna.

description: Global extraction of raw materials more than tripled in the past 45 years, from 27 billion tonnes in 1970 to 86 billion tonnes in 2015, an overall growth of 222%. Two distinct phases of material extraction can be identified. A period of modest growth between 1970 and 2002, with only two short periods of stagnation, caused by the 1979 energy crisis and the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991. From 2003 onwards, growth of global material extraction increased significantly, mainly driven by the rise of emerging economies such as China and India. 

Growth rates were unevenly distributed among the main material categories. Particularly the extraction of industrial and construction minerals increased significantly (by more than 350%), indicating the continued importance of this resource category for industrial development, in particular for building up housing, energy and transport infrastructure in emerging economies, such as China. Global extraction of metal ores increased by 229% and fossil fuels by 132% in the 45-years period. Increases in biomass extraction amounted to 147%. Hence, the share of renewable resources in total global resource extraction is constantly decreasing (from around 33% in 1970 to around 25% in 2015).

description: The analysis of regional trends in material extraction illustrates that Asia's share in global material extraction has increased remarkably in the past 45 years (from 25% to 57%), and particularly since the early 2000s (from 43% to 57%). This is the consequence of rapid industrialisation in countries such as China and India. In China, for example, between 1970 and 2015, extraction of minerals increased by more than 3,500%, as a consequence of huge increases in demand in particular for construction materials, such as sand and gravel or limestone for cement production. Also extraction of metal ores, fossil fuels, and biomass grew by 3,910%, 765% and 261%, respectively. The overall increase in extraction was 1,350%, as compared to an increase of around 635% in the Asia & Pacific region and, for example, around 328% in India. In the latter, fossil fuels (instead of non-metallic minerals) were the material category of which extraction increased the most (by 821%).
In comparison, overall material extraction grew only marginally within Europe (+33%), thus reducing the share of Europe in worldwide material extraction massively (from 29% in 1970 to 9% in 2015). This trend was mainly driven by the reduction of fossils fuel extraction, mostly coal, in Europe. At the same time, extraction of biomass within Europe increased by 54%. Also the shares of North America and Africa in absolute global material extraction declined - from 23% to 9%, and from 8% to 7%, respectively.
Note: from 1992 on, the ex-USSR countries Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, formerly part of the region "Asia", are part of the region "Europe".

description: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) publishes annual national account balance in the form of balance of payments (BoP) that is the sum of net exports of goods and services, net primary income, and net secondary income. BoP a double-entry accounting system that shows all flows of goods and services into and out of an economy; all transfers that are the counterpart of real resources or financial claims provided to or by the rest of the world without a quid pro quo, such as donations and grants; and all changes in residents' claims on and liabilities to nonresidents that arise from economic transactions. All transactions are recorded twice - once as a credit and once as a debit. In principle, the net balance should be zero, but in practice the accounts often do not balance, requiring inclusion of a balancing item, net errors and omissions. The concepts and definitions underlying the data are based on the sixth edition of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6). Balance of payments data for 2005 onward will be presented in accord with the BPM6. The historical BPM5 data series will end with data for 2008, which can be accessed through the World Development Indicators archives.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Discrepancies may arise in the balance of payments because there is no single source for balance of payments data and therefore no way to ensure that the data are fully consistent. Sources include customs data, monetary accounts of the banking system, external debt records, information provided by enterprises, surveys to estimate service transactions, and foreign exchange records. Differences in collection methods - such as in timing, definitions of residence and ownership, and the exchange rate used to value transactions - contribute to net errors and omissions. In addition, smuggling and other illegal or quasi-legal transactions may be unrecorded or misrecorded.

description: The VIIRS active fires data (VNP14IMGT) is the latest fire monitoring product to FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System), which identifies global fire locations in near-real time. Information is collected from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor, and processed with a fire detection algorithm to flag active fires. Each dot on the map represents the center of a 375 meter pixel that has been flagged by the algorithm. The VIIRS data replaces the active fires data from MODIS that was previously available on Global Forest Watch. The VIIRS data has higher spatial resolution (375-meter pixels vs. 1-kilometer pixels) which improves detection of smaller fires and provides a more reliable estimate of fire perimeters. The VIIRS data is also better calibrated to detect fires at night. The active fires data is available to view and download for the past 24 hours, 48 hours, or 7 days. Older fire data will be available for download from the NASA FIRMS website beginning in mid-2016. Each fire alert has a confidence value of low, nominal, or high to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot /fire pixels. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Not all fires are detected. There are several reasons why VIIRS may not have detected a certain fire. The fire may have started and ended between satellite overpasses. The fire may have been too small or too cool to be detected in the 375-meter pixel. Cloud cover, heavy smoke, or tree canopy may completely obscure a fire. It is not recommended to use active fire locations to estimate burned area due to spatial and temporal sampling issues. When zoomed out, this data layer displays some degree of inaccuracy because the data points must be collapsed to be visible on a larger scale. Zoom in for greater detail.

description: Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Production (1970-2080) from Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) is an update to a major crop modeling study by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS). The initial study was published in 1997, based on output of the HadCM2 model forced with greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration from the IS95 emission scenarios in 1997. Results of the initial study are presented in Socio Economic Data and Applications Center's (SEDAC) Potential Impacts of Climate Change on World Food Supply: Data Sets from a Major Crop Modeling Study, released in 2001. The coauthors developed and tested a method for investigating the spatial implications of climate change on crop production. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) dynamic process crop growth models are specified and validated for 127 sites in the major world agricultural regions.  Results from the crop models, calibrated and validated in the major crop-growing regions, are then used to test functional forms describing the response of yield changes in the climate and environmental conditions as a percent change by country. The baseline year for crop yield changes is the average yield simulated under current climate (1970-2000 baseline). The resulting yield change data were then fed into trade models to assess impacts on prices and overall food production. Optimal yield is the potential yield non limited by water, fertilizer, and without management constraints. Adapted yields are evaluated in each country as a fraction of the potential yield. The weighting factor combines the ratio of current yields to current yield potential and the economic limitation of the economic country’s agricultural systems. This updated version is based on HadCM3 model output along with GHG concentrations from the SRES. The crop yield estimates incorporate some major improvements: 1) consistent crop simulation methodology and climate change scenarios; 2) weighting of model site results by contribution to regional and national, and rainfed and irrigated production; 3) quantitative foundation for estimation of physiological CO₂ effects on crop yields; 4) explicit consideration of adaptation; and 5) reporting of results by country rather than by Basic Linked System region. The data are presented at a national level. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Total production changes need to be treated with caution, since production is determined by many factors. These projections are all speculative and could have innacuracies. Caution should be used when using projections for any decisions that may have any negative consequences.

description: The Global Surface Water data set contains maps  of the location and temporal distribution of surface water from 1984 to 2015 and provides statistics on the extent and change of those water surfaces. These data were generated using 3,066,102 scenes from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 acquired between 16 March 1984 and 10 October 2015. Each pixel was individually classified into water / non-water using an expert system and the results were collated into a monthly history for the entire time period and two epochs (1984-1999, 2000-2015) for change detection. The mapping layers product consists of 1 image containing 7 bands. It maps different facets of the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water over the last 32 years. Areas where water has never been detected are masked. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Any bodies of water smaller than 30-m resolution are not be recognized. Similarly, bodies of water obscured by vegetation or built infrastructure are not recognized. Gaps in the image archives due to cloud cover or sensor failure can lead to instances of surface water being missed. Not all regions of the world are represented from the beginning of this data set in 1984. For example, parts of Siberia and Kolyma were not included in the image record until 1999 and 1995, respectively. The data were checked for errors of omission (not labeling a pixel as water when it was) and for errors of commission (labeling a pixel as water when it was not), and some of these errors were corrected. Some errors remain, partly due to errors of commission stemming from needing improved urban area and infrastructural information to help train the decision algorithms not to confuse built areas for water. A failure of Landsat 7's scan line corrector (SLC) caused the loss of about 22% of each scene, resulting in fragmented images. This occasionally led to potentially confusing results, which can be identified as sections of the water occurrence maps having a "slatted appearance."

description: The German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) partnered with UNESCO's International Hydrological Programme and the International Association of Hydrogeologists to coordinate the World-wide Hydrogeological Mapping and Assessment Programme (WHYMAP). The Map of Global Groundwater Vulnerability (GWV) to Floods and Droughts at the scale of 1:25,000,000 is a WHYMAP product that rates groundwater systems on a scale of 1 to 7 according to their vulnerability to drought and flood events. Vulnerability is defined as a system's sensitivity to natural and/or human impacts, and the ability of the system to cope with these impacts. This information can be used to prioritize which groundwater resources can be relied on in case of a natural disaster.  The maps of groundwater systems were sourced from national, regional, and global sources. Many aquifer boundaries were sourced from the WHYMAP Groundwater Resources Map (GRM). The GRM includes major groundwater basins, areas with complex hydrogeological structures, and local and shallow aquifers. These were complemented by aquifers in fluvial deposits of large rivers from the Geological Map of the World, aquifers in carbonate rocks—usually karstified—from the World Map of Carbonate Rock Outcrops, and the WHYMAP database for aquifers with nonrenewable groundwater. The extent of the impact of different natural disasters on aquifers and their groundwater resources differs depending on factors such as the origin of the disaster, its intensity and frequency, the hydrogeological conditions and geographical position of the aquifer (coastal area or a floodplain), and other factors affecting vulnerability (shallow or deep, whether groundwater is nonrenewable). The GWV uses a simplified version of the DRASTIC index for assessing groundwater vulnerability, measuring aquifer vulnerability according to the type of aquifer and the aquifer’s groundwater recharge rate. Aquifer types are assessed according to the map sources mentioned above. Groundwater recharge rates are calculated using the WaterGAP hydrogeological model and categorized as < 20 mm/year, 20-100 mm/year, or > 100 mm/year.   A total vulnerability range (TVR) is assigned to each aquifer based on its type and recharge rate. Aquifer type is weighted more than rate of recharge in this calculation, since aquifers in carbonate rocks (often karstified) or in fluvial deposits of large rivers and shallow and local aquifers are all highly vulnerable to natural disasters—particularly floods, storms, and tsunamis—and are also highly vulnerable to droughts in arid and semiarid regions. Natural disasters include 1) hydro-climatic events (floods, droughts, storms); 2) geological events (earthquakes, volcanic activity); and 3) events caused by a combination of hydroclimatic and geological factors (tsunamis, landslides). The GWV focuses on hydroclimatic events, and the vulnerability of each aquifer is assessed for floods and droughts. The map assigns 7 categories of vulnerability based on the combination of flood and drought vulnerability (low, low; low, moderate; etc). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Visualizations and maps of vulnerability for groundwater resources will vary greatly depending on which parameters are used to describe each aquifer, and the weighting and rating system used to quantify the level of vulnerability implied by aquifer properties. The Global Groundwater Vulnerability Map is intended for use as a global overview. Because of its small scale and the impact of that scale on the content, the map is not suitable to be used for site-specific and local purposes. It is not a substitute for vulnerability maps on national and local levels, which do provide useful tools for planning, regulatory, managerial, and decision-making purposes, and help environmentally sound decision-making regarding land use and groundwater protection. The biggest constraint and limitation in the construction and use of the Global Groundwater Vulnerability Map is the scarcity of reliable data on groundwater. The type of credible, compatible, and spatially distributed data and information that is routinely applied in creating groundwater vulnerability maps on a larger scale is not available on a worldwide basis. For global groundwater vulnerability assessment and mapping to be carried out effectively in the future, it is essential to improve the availability of data. This will require regular groundwater monitoring programs, which will provide readily accessible and compatible data for assessing the current state of groundwater quality and quantity.

description: Ramsar Wetlands refer to "Internally Important" Wetlands as defined by the Convention on Wetlands and are designated by each contracting pary.At the time of joining the Convention, each Contracting Party must designate at least one wetland site within their territory for inclusion in the List of Wetlands of International Importance (the Ramsar List). These Ramsar Sites acquire a new national and international status. They are recognized as being of significant value not only for the country or the countries in which they are located, but for humanity as a whole. There are currently over 2,200 Ramsar Sites around the world. They cover over 2.1 million square kilometres, an area larger than Mexico. Parties continue to designate wetlands for inclusion in the List. They select suitable wetlands for designation by referring to the Criteria for identifying Wetlands of International Importance. The Convention has provided guidance to Contracting Parties on the management of Ramsar Sites, in addition to its guidance on the wise use of all wetlands. The inclusion of a wetland in the List embodies the government’s commitment to take the steps necessary to ensure that its ecological character is maintained. The Convention includes various measures to respond to threats to the ecological character of Sites.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: All Site information is provided by the Contracting Parties to the Convention and is managed by the Ramsar Secretariat. Responsibility for the accuracy of the data lies with the Administrative Authority of the Party in which the Ramsar Site is located.

description: The Relative Sea Level Trends data set was created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and shows relative sea level rise measured at various global coastal locations. Relative sea level trends are determined based on a combination of the fluctuations of the ocean and the vertical land motion at the location of the station. Monthly mean sea level (MSL) variations were analyzed for 128 stations in the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) of the National Ocean Service (NOS) that have between 30 and 146 years of data. The sea level variations determined are the linear trend, the average seasonal cycle, and the interannual variability at each station. Monthly data up to the end of 2006 were used in the calculation, and all stations had data spanning 30 years or more. Since the derived trends include the local vertical land motion, they are spatially variable. Calculated MSL trends range from 9.85 mm/yr for Grand Isle, LA, to -16.68 mm/yr for Skagway, AK, and are consistent with previous trends published by the NOS. Available data from this project include time series plots for each station of the monthly MSL with the seasonal cycle removed, a 5-month average, and the linear trend with its 95% confidence interval, which was obtained after accounting for the average seasonal cycle; the seasonal cycle; the interannual variation of mean sea level for all data to 2006; and the interannual variation from 1980 to the present (updated monthly). The location and timing of any major earthquakes near stations in tectonically active areas are noted since an associated vertical offset or a change in MSL trend is possible. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: There are gaps in available NOAA SLR data at some locations. Newer stations on the West Coast and Alaska, for example, have shorter periods of data collection and tend to have a wider confidence interval as a result. Relative sea level rise can also be impacted by ENSO events and tectonic activity, which can produce results irrelevant to broader trends.

description: The GLIMS: Global Glacier Database managed by the NSIDC is an international collaborative project that includes more than 60 institutions worldwide. Its goal is to create this globally comprehensive inventory of land ice including measurements of glacier area, geometry, surface velocity, and snow line elevation. To perform these analyses, the GLIMS project uses satellite data, primarily from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) as well as historical information derived from maps and aerial photographs. The analysis results are submitted to the GLIMS database at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado. The GLIMS database is designed to be a logical extension of the World Glacier Inventory (WGI) of the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) and stores the full complement of the WGMS-defined glacier characteristics. Each analysis received by the GLIMS team at the NSIDC is ingested into the GLIMS Glacier Database. New glacier data are continually being added to the database.

description: The Global Roads Open Access Data Set, Version 1 (gROADSv1) was developed under the auspices of the CODATA Global Roads Data Development Task Group. The data set combines the best available roads data by country into a global roads coverage, using the UN Spatial Data Infrastructure Transport (UNSDI-T) version 2 as a common data model. All country road networks have been joined topologically at the borders, and many countries have been edited for internal topology. Source data for each country are provided in the documentation, and users are encouraged to refer to the readme file for use constraints that apply to a small number of countries. Because the data are compiled from multiple sources, the date range for road network representations ranges from the 1980s to 2010 depending on the country (most countries have no confirmed date), and spatial accuracy varies. The baseline global data set was compiled by the Information Technology Outreach Services (ITOS) of the University of Georgia. Updated data for 27 countries and 6 smaller geographic entities were assembled by Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), with a focus largely on developing countries with the poorest data coverage. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Data are compiled from multiple sources, not all of which will have the same level of spatial accuracy in their road shapefiles. Data from these sources were available for different time periods, ranging from the 1980s to 2010 depending on the country. Some countries do not have a confirmed date of assessment.

description: The GRanD (v1) 2011 data set is produced with a consortium of partners led by the Global Water System Project in Bonn, Germany. The data incorporates dam point location and reservoir polygons from a variety of sources, creating a global, harmonized account of dams and reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 0.1 km³. Smaller dams and reservoirs were added if data were available, or if the dam is of particular socioeconomic importance. There are strong connections between the GRanD data set and the HydroSHEDS database (metadata available through Resource Watch). When multiple dams are associated with one reservoir polygon, the dam with the highest expected rate of outflow from the reservoir, as measured by the HydroSHEDS digital elevation model and flow accumulation measures, is chosen as the main dam. The main source of GRanD reservoir polygons is the SRTM Water Body Database (SWBD), another link between the GRanD and HydroSHEDS data sets. The original dam and reservoir data sets did not include explicit polygon information for many reservoirs. The participating consortium of partners worked to identify reservoir polygons using the SWBD and other tools. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The Urban Heat Island effect represents the relatively higher temperatures found in urban areas compared to surrounding rural areas owing to higher proportions of impervious surfaces and the release of waste heat from vehicles and heating and cooling systems. Paved surfaces and built structures tend to absorb shortwave radiation from the sun and release long-wave radiation after a lag of a few hours. The Global Urban Heat Island Data Set, 2013, estimates the land surface temperature in urban areas in degrees Celsius (average summer daytime maximum and average summer nighttime minimum) as well as the difference between those temperatures and the temperatures in surrounding rural areas, defined as a 10 km buffer around the urban extent. Urban extents are from SEDAC’s Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1), and land surface temperatures are from SEDAC’s Global Summer Land Surface Temperature (LST) Grids, 2013, which are derived from the Aqua Level-3 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Version 5 global daytime and nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LST) 8-day composite data (MYD11A2). For most regions, the UHI data set provides the average daytime maximum (1:30 p.m. overpass) and average nighttime minimum (1:30 a.m. overpass) temperatures in urban and rural areas, and the urban-rural temperature differences, derived from LST data representing a 40-day time-span during July-August (Julian days 185-224) in the Northern Hemisphere and January-February (Julian days 001-040) in the Southern Hemisphere. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: LST grid cells with missing values resulting from high cloud cover in tropical regions were filled with daytime maximum and nighttime minimum LST values from April to May 2013 in the Northern Hemisphere and December 2013 to January 2014 in the Southern Hemisphere, where available. Some data gaps remain in areas where data were insufficient (e.g., Central Africa).

description: This data set, a collaboration between the GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) lab at the University of Maryland, Google, USGS, and NASA, displays tree cover over all global land (except for Antarctica and a number of Arctic islands) for the year 2000 at 30 × 30 meter resolution. This layer displays all vegetation greater than 5 m in height with >30% canopy density.  Data in this layer were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+) sensor. The clear surface observations from over 600,000 images were analyzed using Google Earth Engine, a cloud platform for earth observation and data analysis, to determine per pixel tree cover using a supervised learning algorithm.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: For the purpose of this study, “tree cover” was defined as all vegetation taller than 5 m in height. “Tree cover” is the biophysical presence of trees and may take the form of natural forests or plantations existing over a range of canopy densities.

description: Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is an important heat-trapping (greenhouse) gas, which is released through human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels, as well as natural processes such as respiration and volcanic eruptions. The first graph shows atmospheric CO₂ levels measured at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, in recent years, with average seasonal cycle removed. The "average" column contains the monthly mean CO₂ mole fraction determined from daily averages. The mole fraction of CO₂, expressed as parts per million (ppm) is the number of molecules of CO₂ in every one million molecules of dried air (water vapor removed). If there are missing days concentrated either early or late in the month, the monthly mean is corrected to the middle of the month using the average seasonal cycle. Missing months are denoted by -99.99. The "interpolated" column includes average values from the preceding column and interpolated values where data are missing. Interpolated values are computed in two steps. First, we compute for each month the average seasonal cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value. In this way the seasonal cycle is allowed to change slowly over time. We then determine the "trend" value for each month by removing the seasonal cycle; this result is shown in the "trend" column. Trend values are linearly interpolated for missing months. The interpolated monthly mean is then the sum of the average seasonal cycle value and the trend value for the missing month. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change, depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same reasons. Usually these changes are minor.

description: The Conflict and Protest Events in Asian and African States data produced by ACLED give information on the specific dates and locations of political violence and protest, the types of events, the groups involved, fatalities, and changes in territorial control. Information is recorded on the battles, killings, riots, and recruitment activities of rebels, governments, militias, armed groups, protesters, and civilians, including events that occur in the context of civil wars and periods of instability, public protest, and regime breakdown. ACLED has recorded nearly 200,000 individual events, with ongoing data collection focused on Africa and 10 countries in South and Southeast Asia. These data can be used for immediate and long-term analysis and mapping of political violence and protest across developing countries through use of historical data, as well as informing humanitarian and development work in crisis and conflict-affected contexts through real-time data updates and reports. The project covers all African countries from 1997 to the present, and select countries in the Middle East and Asia from 2010 or 2018. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: All ACLED data remain subject to some limitations, and this is particularly true of fatality data. While the "hard facts" of data such as the date, location, and actors have been shown to be largely consistent with those of private, closed security sources, fatality data are particularly vulnerable to bias and inaccurate reporting. If there are conflicting reports of the number of fatalities, ACLED researchers will note the varying reported figures in the Notes column and use the figure cited by the most authoritative source. In the absence of a definitive authoritative source, ACLED will assign the most conservative estimate cited to the Fatalities column. Users are urged to remember that fatality figures reflected reported levels of deaths and have not been independently verified by team researchers.

description: This data set was generated by Aberystwyth University and soloEO within the framework of the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) project, which is a part of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Kyoto & Carbon (K&C) Initiative and the Mangrove Capital Africa Programme coordinated by Wetlands International and financed by DOB Ecology. The map (v1.2) depicts the global extent of mangrove forests for the year 2010, derived by Random Forest Classification of both L-band radar (ALOS PALSAR) and optical (Landsat-5, -7) data. All satellite data and software used to derive the GMW mangrove maps are available in the public domain. Approximately 15,000 Landsat scenes and 1,500 ALOS PALSAR (1 x 1 degree) mosaic tiles were used to create mosaics of optical and radar data covering the tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate coastlines of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania where mangroves occur. The classification was confined using a mangrove habitat mask, which defined regions where mangrove ecosystems can be expected to exist. The mangrove habitat definition was based on geographical parameters such as latitude, elevation and distance from ocean water. Training for the habitat mask and classification of the 2010 mangrove mask was based on a randomly sample of 38 million points using the mangrove masks (for the year 2000) of Giri et al. (2011) and Spalding et al. (2010) and the water occurrence layer defined by Pekel et al. (2017). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The Landsat-7 ETM+ scanline error affects the classification in certain areas, resulting in striping artefacts in the data. Classification accuracy was assessed with over 53,800 randomly sampled points across 20 randomly selected regions. Overall accuracy was 95.25 %, while User’s and Producer’s accuracies for the mangrove class were estimated at 97.5% and 94.0%, respectively. Users should be aware that it is a global-scale dataset, generated with a single methodology applied over all regions. As such, the accuracy of the map may vary between locations. Factors such as satellite data availability (due to clouds, cloud shadows and Landsat-7 ETM+ scanline error), mangrove species composition and level of degradation all influence the accuracy. The mangrove seaward border is generally more accurately defined than the landward side, where the distinction between mangrove and certain terrestrial vegetation types (e.g. tropical rainforest) can be lower. Areas known to be missing in this version (v1.2) of the dataset: Bermuda (U.K.); Europa Island (France); Fiji, east of longitude 180°E; Maldives; Nicobar Islands (India); Guam and Saipan (U.S.); Peru, south of latitude 4°S; Kosrae island (Micronesia); and Wallis and Futuna Islands (France).

description: The social and economic vulnerability data set was produced for the Reefs at Risk project by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and classifies the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) for 108 coral reef countries and territories according to an index of their reef dependence, adaptive capacity, and social vulnerability. Results are presented as quartiles, with 27 countries/territories classified in each of 4 categories (low, medium, high, and very high for reef dependence and social vulnerability; very low, low, medium, and high for adaptive capacity). The reef dependence index is based on the following inputs: reef-associated population, reef fisheries employment, reef-associated exports, nutritional dependence on fish and seafood, reef-associated tourism, and shoreline protection. The adaptive capacity index is based on the following inputs: economic resources, education, health (expressed as life expectancy), governance, access to markets, and agricultural resources. The social vulnerability index is the result of the combination of the Reef Dependence index, Adaptive Capacity index, and Exposure to Reef Threats (i.e., the Reefs at Risk integrated local threat index). The Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) for uninhabited and sparsely inhabited territories with coral reefs are also included in this shapefile, but are not included in the indices. The purpose of this data set is to provide a comparative analysis of coral reef countries and territories according to their reef dependence, adaptive capacity, and social and economic vulnerability to reef loss. Results were compiled at the national level, or in some cases the sub-national level where data were available. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The analysis relies on available data and predicted relationships but cannot capture all aspects of the dynamic interactions between people and coral reefs. The indicators gauge current and potential levels of vulnerability. A strength of the analysis lies in its use of nationally consistent data sets to develop globally consistent indicators of vulnerability to reef loss and degradation. However, the model is not perfect, and omissions and other errors in the data sets are inevitable.

description: This cumulative impact index ranging from ranging from 0 (no change) to 1 (maximum change) for the impact of climate change on oceans was calculated using sea surface temperature (SST), ocean productivity measured by chlorophyll (CHL), and ocean circulation by Ramirez et al. (2017). The data to calculate were from the longest time series of remote-sensing records (annual composites) on SST (1980–2014), CHL (1979–2014), and marine currents (1980–2014) available to provide finest-scale measurements of the impacts of climate change on the marine environment globally. Pixel basis, least-squares linear regression of annual information from SST, CHL, and the eastern and northern components of water speed were used for deriving the significance of temporal trends, and its magnitudes (slopes; that is, annual changes in target features) over the past 3 decades. CHL data were sourced online as annual composites, whereas data on SST and marine currents were obtained on a monthly basis and averaged yearly to generate a linear relationship to extract slopes. This calculation was repeated for every pixel of the globe. These magnitudes were combined to obtain the spatially explicit Cumulative Impact Index. Different layers were first resampled following a bilinear interpolation procedure to match the spatial resolution of the coarsest SST product (that is, 1° grid). Absolute values for the slopes of obtained trends (a proxy to the magnitude of environmental changes) were then standardized to the maximum value to make all variables comparable. These relative values (ranging from 0 [no change] to 1 [maximum recorded change]) were subsequently added on a pixel basis and standardized again to the maximum value. In this way, researchers obtained a dimensionless index ranging from 0 (no change) to 1 (maximum change), thereby providing information about spatial heterogeneity in the magnitude of environmental changes and highlighting those marine areas that have undergone the largest changes in their environmental conditions. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Thermal Anomalies/Fire products are primarily derived from MODIS 4- and 11-micrometer radiances. The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). The product includes fire occurrence (day/night), fire location, the logical criteria used for the fire selection, detection confidence, Fire Radiative Power and numerous other layers describing fire pixel attributes. The product distinguishes between fire, no fire and no observation. Level 3 Daily fire products include 8 separate days of data detailing pixels according to their level of confidence as fires. This information will be used in monitoring the spatial and temporal distribution of fires in different ecosystems, detecting changes in fire distribution and identifying new fire frontiers, wild fires, and changes in the frequency of the fires or their relative strength. MODIS data on Terra and Aqua are acquired from each platform twice daily at mid-latitudes. These four daily MODIS fire observations that are typically acquired serve operational fire management needs while also advancing global monitoring of the fire process and its effects on ecosystems, the atmosphere, and climate. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Not all fires are detected. There are several reasons why MODIS may not have detected a certain fire. The fire may have started and ended between satellite overpasses. The fire may have been too small or too cool to be detected in the (approximately) 1 square km pixel. Cloud cover, heavy smoke, or tree canopy may completely obscure a fire. It is not recommended to use active fire locations to estimate burned area due to spatial and temporal sampling issues. When zoomed out, this data layer displays some degree of inaccuracy because the data points must be collapsed to be visible on a larger scale. Zoom in for greater detail.

description: The recent earthquake data produced by the USGS give information on global significant earthquakes located by the USGS and contributing agencies within the last 30 days. The data are updated within 15 minutes of an earthquake's occurrence. An earthquake's significance is calculated based on its magnitude, number of 'Did You Feel It' responses, and the PAGER (fatality and economic loss impact estimates) alert level.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: This should not be considered to be complete list of all events in the US and adjacent areas and especially should not be considered to be complete lists of all 4.5+ magnitude events in the world. In most cases, the USGS locates and reports on earthquakes worldwide of magnitude 5.0 and larger in 30 minutes or less. Additionally, it locates and reports on earthquakes magnitude 4.0 and larger within the contiguous US and populated regions of Alaska within 30 minutes. The USGS may not rapidly locate earthquakes smaller than 5.0 outside the US unless they have caused significant damage or are widely felt. Earthquakes this small rarely cause significant damage. At times, some other agency may report an earthquake with a larger magnitude than what the USGS computes, especially for non-US events near magnitude 5.0. If the USGS magnitude for the event is less than magnitude 5.0, we may not issue a rapid report for it. Earthquakes occurring outside the US and smaller than about magnitude 4.5 can be difficult for the USGS to locate if there are not enough data. The USGS continues to receive data from observatories throughout the world for several months after the events occur. Using these data, it adds new events and revises existing events in later publications. Many regional networks around the world can record smaller earthquakes in their region than the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) global network can, and in many cases these regional networks do not share their data with the NEIC.

description: The Global Oil Pipelines data set was assembled by Professor Jeff Blossom of Harvard University's Center for Geographic Analysis for a workshop in 2009. It gives a partial view of installed crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum product pipeline infrastructure as of August 2009. It covers the entire globe. The lines may not exactly match up with actual pipeline coordinates in some areas, as there was uncertainty in the source maps. Pipelines are snapped to source cities, and the paths between cities are slightly stylized while maintaining the general trend of each pipeline's path. Esri's ArcGIS tool was used to georeference pipeline data from Theodora.com's pipeline maps: http://www.theodora.com/pipelines/. These maps were in turn assembled from a variety of different sources. According to the Theodora site, no claims are made regarding the accuracy of the world pipelines data. Not all pipelines contained in Theodora maps were transferred to this map. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: There is a level of uncertainty in the source maps from Theodora.com, as well as in the methodology used to georeference these pipelines by hand in ArcGIS. The data has not been updated since 2009, and there has likely been substantive development of pipeline infrastructure in the intervening time.

The AZE identifies and safeguards places where species evaluated to be endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature are restricted to single remaining sites. The data are updated every 5 years, and the 2010 revised data include 587 habitat sites for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. The species found within these sites have extremely small global ranges and populations; any change to habitat within a site may lead to the extinction of a species in the wild. To meet AZE criteria, a site must (1) contain at least one endangered or critically endangered species; (2) contain greater than 95% of either the known resident population of the species or 95% of the known population of one life history segment (e.g., breeding or wintering) of the species; and (3) have a definable boundary (e.g., species range, extent of contiguous habitat, etc.). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The Ecoregions Prioritized for Conservation released by The Nature Conservatory (TNC) provides a vision for conservation success for ecological systems, natural communities, and species representative of an ecoregion by showing the boundaries of areas that TNC has prioritized for conservation in 2011. Many portfolio areas were derived from ecoregional assessments, but other priorities derived using other planning methodologies are included in this global data set. Ecoregional assessment is a method for setting geographic priorities based on the status of biodiversity, habitat condition, threats, and sociopolitical conditions in an ecoregion. In more detail, ecoregional assessments use ecoregions as the unit of analysis. For an ecoregion or collection of ecoregions, TNC develops and disseminates finer-scale data on the distribution and status of biodiversity, habitat condition, current and future threats, and the sociopolitical conditions that influence conservation success within those ecoregions. These finer-scale data allow TNC to set long-term conservation goals for ecosystems, natural communities, and imperiled or declining species representative of an ecoregion, and to establish ecoregional priorities for resource allocation—specific landscapes, threats to biodiversity, and strategic opportunities that affect one or more ecoregions and demand immediate attention. Ecoregional data also provide a baseline against which TNC can measure progress toward the long-term goals for the representative ecosystems and species within an ecoregion. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Ecoregion types do not reflect the average habitat of conservation target species within that ecoregion, but instead account for all preferred habitats regardless of the relative frequency of the target species. TNC defines fourteen standards for ecoregional assessments, but emphasizes that these allow for flexibility due to wide variation of ecoregions and assessment teams. More information on TNC's Standards for Ecoregional Assessments and Biodiversity Visions can be found here: http://www.conservationgateway.org/Files/Pages/standards-ecoregional-ass.aspx.

description: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global spatial data set on marine and terrestrial protected areas available. Protected area data are provided via Protected Planet, the online interface for the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). The WDPA is a joint initiative of the IUCN and UNEP-WCMC to compile spatially referenced information about protected areas. The data are provided as shapefiles and updated monthly. Not all protected areas receive the same degree of protection. While some have strict guidelines designed to preserve intact ecosystems, others allow for sustainable land use, often including limited resource extraction. In addition, not all countries use the same terminology when designating a protected area.Universal management categories are designated by The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) that stipulate the level of protection for most protected areas. These categories are defined below:  Ia. Strict Nature Reserves. Protected areas designed to preserve biodiversity and all geological features. Limited human use (e.g., scientific study, education) is allowed and carefully monitored. Strict Nature Reserves are often used to understand the impact of indirect human disturbance (e.g., burning fossil fuels) because of the area’s high level of preservation.  Ib. Wilderness Areas. Protected areas managed to preserve ecosystem processes with limited human use. Wilderness Areas cannot contain modern infrastructure (e.g., a visitor’s center), but they allow for local indigenous groups to maintain subsistence lifestyles. These areas are often established to restore disturbed environments.  II. National Parks. Protected areas designed to preserve large-scale ecosystems and support human visitation. With conservation as a priority, these areas allow infrastructure and contribute to the local economy by providing opportunities for environmental educational and recreation.  III. National Monuments or Features. Areas established to protect a specific natural feature (e.g., cave, grove) or human-made monument with significant historical, spiritual, or environmental importance and the immediate surroundings. Accordingly, Natural Monuments or Features are typically smaller in area and have high human impact resulting from visitor traffic.  IV. Habitat and Species Management Areas. Areas designed to conserve specific wildlife populations and/or habitats. Habitat and Species Management Areas often exist within a larger ecosystem or protected area and are carefully managed (e.g., through hunting abatement or habitat restoration) to conserve a target species or habitat.   V. Protected Landscapes and Seascapes. Protected areas with ecological, biological, or cultural importance that have been shaped by human use of the landscape. Protected landscapes and seascapes typically cover entire bodies of land or ocean and allow for a number of for-profit activities (e.g., ecotourism) in accordance with the region’s management plan.  VI. Protected Areas with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources. Areas designed to manage natural resources and uphold the livelihoods of surrounding communities. These regions have a low level of human occupation, small-scale developments (i.e., not industrial), and part of the landscape in its natural condition. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Protected area boundaries come from a variety of sources, with varying accuracy, up-to-dateness, and resolution. Data for some countries may be imprecise, miss some protected areas, or include boundaries that have since been canceled. Protected area designations, such as “National Park,” can be applied differently in different countries and may be associated with different IUCN categories. Only areas that meet the IUCN definition of protected areas are collected by the WDPA, and thus the data may differ from national-level data on protected areas. Protected areas with no boundary data are displayed as boxes that represent the reported protected area size. The box is centered on a single point location, and the borders do not indicate the real boundary of the protected area.

description: The Gender Inequality Index (GII), released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), is an inequality index for 159 countries from 1995 to 2015. It measures gender inequalities and is calculated using 3 important aspects of human development: 1) reproductive health, measured by maternal mortality ratio and adolescent birth rates; 2) empowerment, measured by proportion of parliamentary seats occupied by females and proportion of adult females and males aged 25 years and older with at least some secondary education; and 3) economic status, expressed as labor market participation and measured by labor force participation rate of female and male populations aged 15 and older. The index ranges from 0, where women and men fare equally, to 1, where one gender fares as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions. The higher the GII value the more disparities between females and males and the more loss to human development. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The Gender Inequality Index does not capture the length and breadth of gender inequality. For example, the use of national parliamentary representation excludes participation at the local government level and elsewhere in community and public life. The labor market dimension lacks information on employment, having an adequate job, and unpaid work that is mostly done by women. In addition, the index misses other important dimensions, such as time use---the fact that many women have the additional burden of caregiving, and housekeeping cuts into their leisure time and increases stress and physical exhaustion. Lastly, asset ownership, child care support, gender-based violence, and participation in community decision making are also not captured in the GII, mainly due to limited data availability.

description: The percentage of population exposed to levels exceeding United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines of PM2.5 are derived from estimates of annual concentrations of very fine particulates produced by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, an international scientific effort led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The percent of population exposed to ambient concentrations of PM2.5 that exceed the WHO guideline value is defined as the portion of a country’s population living in places where mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 are greater than 10 micrograms per m², the guideline value recommended by the World Health Organization as the lower end of the range of concentrations over which adverse health effects due to PM2.5 exposure have been observed. Estimates of annual concentrations are generated by combining data from atmospheric chemistry transport models, satellite observations of aerosols in the atmosphere, and ground-level monitoring of particulates. Overlaying PM2.5 estimates with gridded population data, the percent of a nation's people that lives in areas where PM2.5 concentrations exceed recommended levels is calculated by summing the population for grid cells where PM2.5 concentrations are beyond a threshold value, in this case 10 micrograms per m², and then dividing by total population. These data were collected globally at the country level from 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010-2015.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Pollutant concentrations are sensitive to local conditions, and even monitoring sites in the same city may register different levels. Direct monitoring of PM2.5 is still rare in most parts of the world, and measurement protocols and standards are not the same for all countries. These data should be considered as only a general indication of air quality, intended to inform cross-country comparisons of the health risks due to particulate matter pollution. The guideline set by the World Health Organization (WHO) for PM2.5 is that annual mean concentrations should not exceed 10 micrograms per m², representing the lower range over which adverse health effects have been observed. The WHO has also recommended guideline values for emissions of PM2.5 from burning fuels in households.

description: Based on the global water-risk indicators from the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas (Aqueduct), a weighted aggregation methodology was applied to bring Aqueduct’s catchment-level information up to the country and river basin scales. This methodology addresses each of the challenges by starting with indicators that were computed within basic hydrological units, and assigning spatially explicit weights to reflect the importance of the specific areas based on where water is being used. From these calculations, estimates of the average level of exposure to 5 of Aqueduct’s physical water quantity risk indicators were generated for all countries and major river basins worldwide. These indicators include 1) baseline water stress: the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to total available annual renewable supply; 2) interannual variability: the variation in water supply between years; 3) seasonal variability: the variation in water supply between months of the year; 4) flood occurrence: the number of floods recorded from 1985 to 2011; and 5) drought severity: the average length of drought times. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: These global indicators are best suited for comparison among countries and major river basins to help companies, investors, and governments assess water-quantity-related risk at the country and basin scales, because of the inherent limitations in trying to simplify complex phenomena into a single number. Where available, more detailed, locally sourced data should be preferred for assessing water-related risks and supporting decision-making processes. Information is lost when aggregating indicators from a smaller scale. Many countries, such as the United States, and river basins, such as the Ganges-Brahmaputra, are large enough to span multiple climatic zones, and the process of averaging indicator values can disguise regions with very low or very high water-related risks. These indicators measure the underlying factors that drive water-quantity related risks across countries and river basins, and are not designed to capture the effects of governance regimes, water quality, or investments in water-availability solutions.  Resource Watch does not display complete data set.

description: The Aqueduct Global Flood Risk Maps measures river flood impacts by urban damage, affected GDP, and affected population at the country, state, and river basin scale across the globe, as well as 120 cities. The maps estimate current flood risk for a specific geographic unit, taking into account existing local flood protection levels. They project future flood risk with three climate and socio-economic change scenarios. For the current scenario, hydrological data from 1960 through 1999 were used for generating flood inundations for 9 return periods, from 2-year flood to 1000-year flood, and 2010 GDP, population, and land use data for assessing flood impacts. For future projections, the following scenarios were used: 5 GCMs (Global Climate Models) from CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) projecting future flood inundations under two climate scenarios, RCP4.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway) and RCP8.5, and projected socio-economic changes using SSP2 (Shared Socio-economic Pathway) and SSP3, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report 5. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: A number of caveats should be taken into account when using the hazard and risk data from the Aqueduct Global Flood Risk Maps: 1) Types of flooding: in this initial version of the maps, only simulate large-scale river flooding was simulated, and not coastal flooding, flash flooding, or pluvial flooding. 2) Flood protection: the flood hazard maps represent situations with no flood protection measures (established, for example, through dikes and water retention areas). Hence, where such measures already exist, the flood extent (and therefore the affected population) will be overestimated. In the results displayed in the online Flood Analyzer, the user can include a protection standard (expressed in terms of a return period in years). 3) Damage estimate assumptions: to estimate urban damage, it was assumed that the relationship between the inundation depth and the actual damage is the same throughout the world. 4) Further uncertainties in the hazard and risk estimates may be due to inaccuracies in the climate data used to estimate river discharges, inaccuracies in the elevation data used to simulate inundation, and model simplifications with respect to the physics.

description: With the goal of producing information for decadal-scale planning, adaptation, and investment, the Aqueduct Water Stress Projections model potential changes in future demand and supply of water by over the next three decades. Global indicators were developed for water demand (withdrawal and consumptive use), water supply, water stress (the ratio of water withdrawal to supply), and intra-annual (seasonal) variability for the periods centered on 2020, 2030, and 2040 for each of two climate scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and two shared socioeconomic pathways, SSP2 and SSP3. Estimates were derived from general circulation models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and mixed-effects regression models based on projected socioeconomic variables from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)’s Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) database. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: These global indicators are best suited for comparative analyses across large geographies to identify regions or assets deserving of closer attention, and are not appropriate for catchment or site-specific analyses.

description: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (WHO/UNICEF JMP) reports global annual data on access to an improved water source based on national censuses and nationally representative household surveys from 1990 to 2015. The coverage rates for water and sanitation are based on information from service users on the facilities their households actually use rather than on information from service providers, which may include nonfunctioning systems. WHO/UNICEF JMP define an improved drinking-water source as one that, by nature of its construction or through active intervention, is protected from outside contamination, in particular from contamination with fecal matter. The improved drinking water source includes piped water on premises (piped household water connection located inside the user’s dwelling, plot or yard), and other improved drinking water sources (public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected dug wells, protected springs, and rainwater collection). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The data on access to an improved water source measure the percentage of the population with ready access to water for domestic purposes. Access to drinking water from an improved source does not ensure that the water is safe or adequate, as these characteristics are not tested at the time of survey. But improved drinking water technologies are more likely than those characterized as unimproved to provide safe drinking water and to prevent contact with human excreta. While information on access to an improved water source is widely used, it is extremely subjective, and such terms as "safe," "improved," "adequate," and "reasonable" may have different meanings in different countries despite official WHO definitions. Even in high-income countries, treated water may not always be safe to drink. Access to an improved water source is equated with connection to a supply system; it does not take into account variations in the quality and cost (broadly defined) of the service. National government data is self-reported and non-standardized.

description: Armed Conflict Location and Event Data in African and Asian States, produced by Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), give information on the specific dates and locations of political violence and protest, the types of events, the groups involved, fatalities, and changes in territorial control. Information is recorded on the battles, killings, riots, and recruitment activities of rebels, governments, militias, armed groups, protesters, and civilians, including events that occur in the context of civil wars and periods of instability, public protest, and regime breakdown. ACLED has recorded nearly 200,000 individual events, with ongoing data collection across Africa, South Asia, South East Asia and the Middle East. These data can be used for immediate and long-term analysis and mapping of political violence and protest across developing countries through use of historical data, as well as informing humanitarian and development work in crisis and conflict-affected contexts through real-time data updates and reports. The project covers all African countries from 1997 to the present, 10 Asian countries from 2015 to the present, and Middle Eastern countries from 2017 to the present, with real-time updates. The map displays conflict and protest events for African states from 2006 to 2016 and Asian states from 2015 to 2016. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: All ACLED data remain subject to some limitations, and this is particularly true of fatality data. While the "hard facts" of data such as the date, location, and actors have been shown to be largely consistent with those of private, closed security sources, fatality data are particularly vulnerable to bias and inaccurate reporting. If there are conflicting reports of the number of fatalities, ACLED researchers will note the varying reported figures in the Notes column and use the figure cited by the most authoritative source. In the absence of a definitive authoritative source, ACLED will assign the most conservative estimate cited to the Fatalities column. Users are urged to remember that fatality figures reflected reported levels of deaths and have not been independently verified by team researchers.

description: The Container Port Connectivity Index (CPCI) is constructed to represent the structure of the global container shipping network, and combines concepts of economics and network topology to assign inbound- and outbound-connectivity scores to all ports in this network. A port with a high inbound score can be interpreted as being a good collection point for global goods, and a port with a high outbound score can be interpreted as being a good distribution point for global goods. This index is the result of research performed at the Georgia Tech Panama Logistics Innovation and Research Center, Chulalongkorn University Department of Industrial Engineering, and University of Hull Logistics Institute. The Container Port Connectivity Index measures the trade connectivity of ports within the network of container shipping, and is broken down into an inbound and outbound index. The data on Resource Watch represents both the inbound and outbound indices of global container ports, calculated using container ship scheduled services for the month of September, 2017. The CPCI is based on a network representation of container ports, where nodes in network represent individual ports, and connections between nodes are weighted based on measures defined by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI). This study uses the same five statistics as the LSCI, but on a port-to-port scale instead of the country-world scale of the LSCI: number of shipping liner services calling between two ports, the number of companies providing those services, the number of ships in those services, the combined container capacity of those ships, and the capacity of the largest ship in service. The Hyperlink-Induced-Topic-Search (HITS) algorithm is used to calculate the inbound- and outbound-connectivity of all ports in this network. Concepts of economics are captured by the LSCI measures included in the weights of the network, and network topology is captured by the application of the HITS algorithm to assign inbound- and outbound-connectivity scores. These scores are ordered to create the CPCI. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Although it has been shown to be correlated with some indicators of country-wise trade activity, the LSCI has been criticized for being an arbitrary collection of indicators. The CPCI specifically inherits one weakness of the LSCI, in that it is based on container capacity as opposed to actual container traffic. This network representation can be used to represent trips between pairs of ports and along port pathways, but it is not detailed enough to comment on the dynamics of transshipment - i.e. journeys where a container would have to be moved between ships on its journey.
functions: Inbound and outbound connectivity scores for all ports in the container shipping network with a high inbound score signifying a good collection point, and a high outbound score signifying a good distribution point for global goods

description: The Land Matrix Online Database on Land Deals tracks large-scale land deals that are made for agricultural production, timber extraction, carbon trading, industry, renewable energy production, conservation, and tourism in low- and middle-income countries. A deal is referred to as an intended, concluded or failed attempt to acquire land through purchase, lease or concession that must 1) entail a transfer of rights to use, control, or ownership of land through sale, lease, or concession; 2) have been initiated since the year 2000; 3) cover an area of 200 ha or more; and 4) imply the potential conversion of land from smallholder production, local community use, or important ecosystem service provision to commercial use. Because of the nature of land acquisitions, it is difficult to obtain this information from official sources, therefore data is attained from 1) research papers and policy reports by international and local organizations and NGOs; 2) personal information contributed through the Global Observatory website; 3) field-based research projects; 4) official government records; 5) company websites; and 6) media reports. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The data set is inherently unreliable, but over time it is expected to become more accurate. Land deals are notoriously untransparent. In many countries, established procedures for decision making on land deals do not exist, and negotiations and decisions do not take place in the public realm. Furthermore, a range of government agencies and levels of government are usually responsible for approving different kinds of land deals. Even official data sources in the same country can therefore vary, and none may actually reflect reality on the ground. Decisions are often changed, and this may or may not be communicated publicly. Therefore, the data of the Global Observatory rely extensively on unofficial sources. Data errors may arise if the information provided by the source is inaccurate. As the information source is provided, users may decide the extent to which they determine the source to be trustworthy. Errors may also arise from mistakes in entering the data. The new database management system accompanying the June 2013 upgrade contains safeguards to detect likely mistakes, but these are impossible to eliminate. Furthermore, errors may arise from the information becoming out of date; we rely on our networks in different countries and users of the website to provide updates. Additional errors or bias may include the following: 1) open data policies in certain countries may give the impression that they have a higher proportion of land deals; 2) media and research interest is often higher in certain regions (e.g., Africa), on certain investors (e.g., emerging investor countries), and in certain sectors (e.g., agriculture and specifically biofuels); 3) foreign investors generally attract more attention than domestic investors, which leads to an underrepresentation of purely domestic deals; 4) networks of Land Matrix partners are important information providers and checkers, leading to a likely underrepresentation of deals in regions such as Eastern Europe and Central Asia where our networks do not have a strong presence; and 5) failed deals and domestic deals are particularly hard to get reliable information for, so these are likely to be underrepresented in the data set. Consequently, trends evident in the database should be taken as indicative, since they are likely to change as the data become more accurate.

description: The Distribution of Agricultural Holders by Sex (Female) data, produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), measure the percentage of female agricultural holders as a percentage of total agricultural holders for 104 countries between 1990 and 2012. The FAO defines an agricultural holder as the civil or juridical person who makes the major decisions regarding resource use and exercises management control over the agricultural holding. The agricultural holder has technical and economic responsibility for the holding. An agricultural holding is an economic unit of agricultural production under single management comprising all livestock kept and all land used wholly or partly for agricultural production purposes, without regard to title, legal form, or size. This data set illustrates the management of agricultural holdings by sex and shows the extent to which women and men have the management responsibility of agricultural production resources. Using national agricultural census and Eurostat data, the percentage of agricultural land held by females is calculated by dividing the number of female agricultural landholders by the total number of agricultural landholders for each country and multiplying this number by 100.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The indicator is measured at the holding level and hence does not capture management within the holding. A holding may consist of several plots of land, with different household members responsible for different plots, but this is generally not captured in the indicator, as typically only one holder is identified per holding. Also, some countries adapt a threshold for minimum size of the holdings included in the census (often due to implementation constraints), leaving out holdings that fall below a certain value. If women are more likely to manage agricultural holdings below the threshold, this could potentially reduce the percentage of female agricultural holders captured by the agricultural census.

description: The Fragile States Index (FSI), produced by the Fund for Peace (FFP), measures the vulnerability of states to collapse. It not only highlights the normal pressures that all states experience but also identifies when pressures exceed a state’s capacity to manage them. FFP collects millions of reports and information from around the world, detailing existing social, economic, and political pressures. Based on the comprehensive social science approach of their Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST), data from 3 main streams-preexisting quantitative data sets, content analysis, and qualitative expert analysis-are triangulated and subjected to critical review to obtain final scores for the index. The higher the index score the closer a state is to failure.The index is produced annually and covers 178 countries. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: Freedom in the World is Freedom House’s flagship annual report, assessing the condition of political rights and civil liberties around the world. It is composed of numerical ratings and supporting descriptive texts for 195 countries and 14 territories. Freedom in the World has been published since 1973, allowing Freedom House to track global trends in freedom over more than 40 years. External analysts assess the 209 countries and territories using a combination of on-the-ground research, consultations with local contacts, and information from news articles, nongovernmental organizations, governments, and a variety of other sources. Expert advisers and regional specialists then vet the analysts’ conclusions. The final product represents the consensus of the analysts, advisers, and Freedom House staff. For each country and territory, Freedom in the World analyzes the electoral process, political pluralism and participation, the functioning of the government, freedom of expression and of belief, associational and organizational rights, the rule of law, and personal autonomy and individual rights. A country or territory is assigned two ratings (7 to 1)—one for political rights and one for civil liberties—based on its total scores for the political rights and civil liberties questions. Each rating of 1 through 7, with 1 representing the greatest degree of freedom and 7 the smallest degree of freedom, corresponds to a specific range of total scores. The average of a country’s or territory’s political rights and civil liberties ratings is called the Freedom Rating, and it is this figure that determines the status of Free (1.0 to 2.5), Partly Free (3.0 to 5.0), or Not Free (5.5 to 7.0). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The Food Loss and Waste by Region data were originally published in the World Resources Institute (WRI) report Reducing Food Loss and Waste and were ultimately derived from a 2011 United Nartions Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report, Global Food Losses and Food Waste: Extent, Causes, and Prevention. The complete data set is available in the FAO report in Annex 4. "Food loss and waste” refers to the edible parts of plants and animals produced or harvested for human consumption but not ultimately consumed by people. It represents a decrease in the mass, caloric, and/or nutritional value of edible food intended for human consumption at any stage in the food value chain. The FAO study calculated the percentages of the weight of foods (categorized as cereals, roots and tubers, oilseeds and pulses, fruits and vegetables, meat, fish and seafood, and milk) that are lost at various stages in the food supply chain. The percentages were calculated for are Agricultural Production, Postharvest Handling and Storage, Processing and Packaging, Distribution, Supermarket Retail, and Consumption. These figures are calculated for the following geographic regions: Europe; North America and Oceania; Industrialized Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa; North Africa, West and Central Asia; South and Southeast Asia; and Latin America. These data were calculated by the Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology (SIK) on behalf of the FAO. Food waste and loss were estimated at each stage of the food supply chain, losses using FAO’s Food Balance Sheets from the year 2007, and results from a thorough literature search on the topic of global food waste. Where there are gaps of knowledge, SIK has made its own assumptions and estimations, based on food waste levels in comparable regions, commodity groups, and/or steps of the Food Supply Chain. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The FAO estimate is based on weight. When considering weight, a ton of grain is the same as a ton of fruit, which is the same as a ton of meat. However, food types vary widely in their water and caloric content per kilogram. For instance, a kilogram of wheat flour on average contains 12% water and 3,643 kcal, whereas a kilogram of apples on average contains 81% water and 1,704 kcal. Consequently, measuring by weight does not consistently reflect the energy in food products that could have been consumed by people. Using the FAO Food Balance Sheets, WRI converted FAO’s loss and waste estimates into calories.

description: The Agriculture Production Value data set is published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in their FAOSTAT database. It includes national data on gross and net production values, in current USD, and gross production values in constant and current USD and local currency units, for various food and agriculture commodities and aggregates thereof, expressed in both total value and value per capita, spanning 1961-2014. Value of gross production is compiled by multiplying gross production in physical terms by output prices at farm gate. Value of gross production measures production in monetary terms at the farm gate level. Since intermediate uses within the agricultural sector (seed and feed) have not been subtracted from production data, this value of production aggregate refers to the notion of "gross production". Value of gross production is provided in both current and constant terms and is expressed in US dollars and standard local currency (SLC). The current value of production measures value in the prices relating to the period being measured. It thus represents the market value of food and agricultural products at the time they were produced. Value of production in constant terms is derived using the average prices of a selected year or years, known as the base period. Constant price series can be used to show how the quantity or volume of products has changed, and are often referred to as volume measures. The ratio of the current and constant price series gives a measure of price movements. US dollar figures for value of gross production are converted from local currencies using official exchange rates as prevailing in the respective years. The SLC of a country is the local currency prevailing in the latest year. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: It is not possible to assess the overall accuracy of the data set, as the source data are largely collected by member countries. For data that are imputed (including for nonreporting countries or for products for which countries do not collect official data), the accuracy of the imputations is unknown. The quality of data varies considerably from country to country depending upon their individual data collection methodologies. However, imputation processes are assessed and adjusted on a regular basis.  No information is available regarding sampling error. In the European Union, regulations mandate that the coefficient of variation shall not exceed 3% for the area of cultivation for main crops. For non-EU countries, the coefficient of variation may be significantly larger. For further information, see country metadata (if available). No information is available regarding the magnitude of nonsampling errors. Nonsampling errors may occur as a result of measurement errors, caused by a lack of harmonization in statistical methods. For instance, significant measurement errors may be present in instances where FAO concepts do not fit with national concepts. There is limited geographical comparability due to differences among countries in methods and coverage, except for regions with homogenous countries, such as EU countries, which are bound by EU regulations on methods, and OECD countries.

Food security for a region is determined according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification approach. This is a standardized approach to classifying the level of food insecurity in a region. Classifications are typically released 4 times a year, each with a short-term (0-3 months from publication) and medium-term (4-7 months from publication) evaluation of food insecurity at the subnational level.    The approach revolves around a consensus-building process. Food security experts review the available evidence to determine a food security classification on a scale of 1 to 5, with phase 1 corresponding to minimal food insecurity, and phase 5 corresponding to famine-level food insecurity. Evidence used includes satellite data measuring precipitation anomalies (CHIRPS SPI), vegetation anomalies (NDVI), and expert opinion based on knowledge of market and trade functioning and socioeconomic dynamics in each region of interest, among others. The data covers select regions from East, West, and Central Africa, Central America, and Afghanistan. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: FEWS NET uses a scenario development method to evaluate the likelihood of food insecurity events up to 6 months into the future and is not global. Evaluations are based on best possible assumptions concerning the drivers of food security and should not be taken as certain predictions.

description: The non-CO₂ agricultural emissions dataset, published the the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in their FAOSTAT database, contains all the non-CO₂ emissions produced in the different agricultural emissions sub-domains (enteric fermentation, manure management, rice cultivation, synthetic fertilizers, manure applied to soils, manure left on pastures, crop residues, cultivation of organic soils, burning of crop residues, burning of savanna, energy use) and provides a picture of their contribution to the total amount of GHG emissions from agriculture. GHG emissions from agriculture tabulated here consist of non-CO₂ gases, namely methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O), produced by crop and livestock production and management activities. The FAOSTAT emissions database is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories. GHG emissions data are provided by countries, regions and special groups, with global coverage, relative to the period 1961-present (with annual updates) and with projections for 2030 and 2050. GHG emissions are expressed as Gg CO₂ and CO₂e (from CH₄ and N₂O), by underlying agricultural emission sub-domain and by aggregate (agriculture total, agriculture total plus energy, agricultural soils). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Accuracy in estimates of GHG emissions depend on the accuracy of activity data and emission factors, and on the choice of methodology. Inaccuracy may be due to, inter alia, generality of algorithms, natural variability, partitioning fractions, lack of spatial or temporal coverage, and/or spatial aggregation. More detailed information is available in the IPCC guidelines.

description: ClimateScope is a partnership between Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), UKaid, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to provide a quantitative assessment of the relative attractiveness of investing in clean energy infrastructure in 58 developing countries around the world. This assessment is based on 4 weighted parameters: Enabling Framework, 40%; Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing, 30%; Low-Carbon Business and Clean Energy Value Chains, 15%; and Greenhouse Gas Management Activities, 15%. Scores are available at the country level, where they are scaled from 0 to 5, and are published yearly. The data used to score countries on these four parameters come from a variety of sources. For some indicators, panels of experts were convened to assess the energy policies of the studied countries in each of the four parameters mentioned above. These assessments were used to assign scores for each country on a variety of clean energy policy relevant metrics. Other elements of a country's final score are determined by reference to published indices, such as the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators 2015 index, which is used to address the question of political risk in countries. Still other elements were determined according to primary research performed by BNEF team members, such as information regarding the amount and source of investment made in clean energy projects to date. The data set spans 2014-2015. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The assessment methodology includes an element of subjective scoring by experts. For example, the clean energy policies indicator is scored according to the perceived policy ambition or effectiveness of a country's clean energy policy framework. In other instances, scores are applied according to expert chosen cutoffs in the analyzed data. For example, a score between 1 and 5 is assigned to a country based on its electrification rate as reported by the International Energy Agency. In other cases, scores of 1-5 are assigned to countries based on their performance in a given indicator relative to other countries in the study sample. These scores should therefore only be used to discuss relative, and not absolute, opportunities for investing in clean energy in each of the study countries.
functions: Quantifies what makes a country attractive for investment in clean energy infrastructure on a scale of 0 to 5.

description: The Energy Facility Emissions data set, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), provides greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for large facilities and industrial sources that emit over 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) per year in the United States. The EPA collects annual reporting of GHG data from these large facilities and publishes the data through the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The data set includes facility names, locations, fuel types, industry sectors and sub-sectors, annual facility emission thresholds, and greenhouse gas types. Users can search for national, state, local, sector, and facility-specific data. All reports submitted to EPA are evaluated by electronic validation and verification checks. This data set reflects 85-90% of total U.S. emissions and spans 2010-2016. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The data set only includes large emitters that emit over 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) per year and reflects only 85-90% of total US emissions.

description: The global Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model is developed by NASA to provide situational awareness of landslide hazards for a wide range of users. Precipitation is a common trigger of landslides. The Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (IMERG) data shows recent precipitation, updated every 30 minutes. A LHASA landslide “nowcast” is created by comparing GPM data from the last 7 days to the long-term precipitation record provided by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA). Because IMERG data are only available starting in 2014, the record of historical rainfall was established by the TMPA, comparing 2001 to the present. The TMPA rainfall probability distributions were then compared to those of IMERG, and the rainfall thresholds were adjusted so that the IMERG data more closely mapped to those of the TMPA archive. The past 7 days of rainfall are considered, with each day weighted according to its date before present, with the last 24 hours having the most impact. In places where precipitation is unusually high, the susceptibility of the terrain is evaluated based on the global landslide susceptibility map, which includes quantitative information on whether (1) roads have been built, (2) trees have been cut down or burned, (3) a major tectonic fault is nearby, (4) the local bedrock is weak, or (5) the hillsides are steep.   Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: A disadvantage of a heuristic fuzzy approach to the creation of the underlying susceptibility map is that the output is a “possibility,” which is not strictly comparable to the probabilities generated by classical statistics; several features of the map thus may limit its use. First, the resolution of the map is approximately 1 km, and terrain varies significantly within many pixels. The choice to aggregate slope by computing the maximum value means that some pixels may contain a very small area of steep terrain, while the remainder is not susceptible to landslides. Second, the use of biased and incomplete landslide inventories to evaluate the susceptibility map makes the results more difficult to interpret. Third, the Geological Map of the World is only appropriate for use over very large areas. At local and national scales, more detailed information is often available, but it varies in quality, format, and cost. Fourth, this map models all mass movements with the same treatment. The real world is more complex, and factors that drive rock toppling in Canada are not the same as those which can cause debris flows in New Guinea. Fifth, this map does not provide an explicit hazard level in the form of an annual probability of slope failure. Therefore, it is very likely that landslides will occur at some date in all of the very highly susceptible locations, but the size, frequency, and timing of those events are not known. These limitations suggest that the global susceptibility map is best used for a few purposes: situational awareness of global landslide hotspots and potential occurrence, the development of global decision support systems, and prioritization of future landslide research. It is not appropriate for decisions about infrastructure design, building code legislation, or local land use planning.

description: The Nominal Rate of Protection (NRP), released by the AgIncentives partnership led by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), measures the extent to which a set of agricultural policies affects the market price of a commodity. It is computed as the price difference, expressed as a percentage, between the farm gate price received by producers and an undistorted reference price at the farm gate level, or the price a farmer receives versus the price a farmer would receive without these policies in place. The reference price is calculated for more than 50 countries using exchange rate, quality and quantity adjustments, transportation and processing costs and etc. The purpose of this indicator is not to provide a holistic measurement of various agricultural policies, in contrast with the Producer Support Estimate or the Nominal Rate of Assistance. It focuses only on the price implications of policies and will be larger for countries using price interventions compared to countries using farm subsidies. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Product and country coverage of an aggregate may vary over time due to changes in data availability. All central information regarding Reference and Farmgate prices are based on each International Organization’s database. The Consortium adds or modifies the information only to guarantee comparability between sources, completeness of the consolidated database, and consistency of the methodology.

description: These three data sets, produced by WWF and RESOLVE, show the location of current tiger habitat and priority areas for habitat conservation. 1) Tiger Conservation Landscapes: Tiger Conservation Landscapes (TCLs) are large blocks of contiguous or connected area of suitable tiger habitat that that can support at least five adult tigers and where tiger presence has been confirmed in the past 10 years. The data set was created by mapping tiger distribution, determined by land cover type, forest extent, and prey base, against a human influence index. Areas of high human influence that overlapped with suitable habitat were not considered tiger habitat. 2) Tx2 Tiger Conservation Landscapes: This data set displays 29 Tx2 Tiger Conservation Landscapes (Tx2 TCLs), defined areas that could double the wild tiger population through proper conservation and management by 2020.  3) Terai Arc Landscape corridors: This data set displays 9 forest corridors on the Nepalese side of the Terai Arc Landscape (TAL). The TAL is an area which encompasses lowlands and the foothills of the Himalayas and contains 14 protected areas in total. Wildlife corridors enable animals to travel between these areas, increasing their long-term survival. Corridors are defined as existing forests connecting current Royal Bengal tiger meta-populations in Nepal and India. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Tiger Conservation Landscapes were created under the assumption that suitable habitat depends on quality and size of land cover and prey base.   Land cover data were problematic in certain geographies due to the presence of tree plantations. In some cases, forest cover was overestimated or underestimated. The tiger location database, on which this data set was built, is incomplete for some regions, and the data come from a variety of sources and research methods.

description: This International Water Events Database is a searchable database documenting over 6,400 historical international water related events from 1948 to 2008. Events in the database concern water as a scarce or consumable resource or as a quantity to be managed. Event information includes the basins and countries involved, date occurred, affected area, BAR scale (water event intensity scale) rating, and a detailed summary of the event. The BAR scale indicates the level of intensity of conflict or cooperation, related to water events and ranks events from -7, representing a formal declaration of war due to the waste, to +7, representing a voluntary unification into one nation.This data set searches and categorizes existing political science data sets. The source of this data set includes Data Development for International Research (DDIR) project, International Crisis Behavior Project (ICB),  the Conflict and Peace Data Bank (COPDAB), the Global Event Data System (GEDS), LEXIS-NEXIS, Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) and Freshwater Dispute Database Project (TFDD).  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: Global Report on Internal Displacement, created by the the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), provides data on the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to conflict, violence and natural disasters worldwide. IDPs suffer from forced nature of displacement within internationally recognized borders. Broadly, IDPs include people who have been forced to flee the source of their livelihoods, such as pastoralists who have left their grazing lands. They also include nonnationals such as migrants, asylum seekers, or stateless people who are displaced by violence or conflict inside a country, and former refugees who have returned to their home country but have not been able to go back to their habitual place of residence. These data can be used to plan resources to assist IDPs in 1) finding temporary housing and 2) establishing a sustainable living situation away from the conflict affecting their original homes or in the aftermath of a disaster event. To collect and disseminate data, the IDMC partners with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as well as country governments, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, nongovernmental organizations, and international media outlets. Data from multiple sources are cross-referenced with each other geographically and temporally to account for biases or double-counting in the reported figures. The total IDPs represent cumulative totals from decades of past conflict through December 31, 2016. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The data sources and each data source's methodology for counting IDPs have changed over the years. Figures from recent years are likely to be more comprehensive in accounting for IDPs displaced from conflict and violence and from sudden-onset natural disasters. The IDMC has data on more than these 55 countries. The IDMC does not post these data due to differences in how the data were collected, and a desire to maintain methodological consistency. The IDMC is still in the process of developing an approach to monitoring displacement associated with drought and other slow-onset phenomena. Global figures for such disasters are not yet available. Currently the IDMC is able to account for more small and medium-sized suddent-onset events than in previous years. Intercountry comparisons of displacement data are now more valid than before, as partners collaborate to develop a common methodology and effectively apply it in their own countries. The IDMC seldom receives data from partners on all aspects of their data model. Sometimes when nuanced data types (such as number of persons who resettled, fled across borders, or died in IDP status) are collected they are reported as aggregated numbers. Other times these data are not collected at all. A distinction is made between a country's population and its inhabitants in order to normalize IDP figures to account for population size. There is risk of double-counting new displacements. Individual IDPs are not tracked, so it is difficult to assess the extent to which this occurs. When people flee across a border it is important that data collectors ask whether they had been IDPs before that point. If this is not verified, people crossing a border are deducted from the country of origin's general population but not from its displaced population. Sometimes multiple sources report displacement figures for the same people, resulting in double-counting. IDMC accounts for this by comparing the geographical and temporal scope of the source's data. Within a country, data for some crises may be well reported while others are not reported at all. Reporting biases include the following:  1) Unequal availability of data: data focused on big events in a small number of countries where international organizations have a strong presence 2) Underreporting of small-scale events; 3)"Invisible" IDPs: more information on IDPs who take refuge at official sites; since unofficial refuge is more common, the official figures are likely substantial underestimates; 4) Real-time reporting is less reliable, but later assessments may underestimate: methods based on damaged or destroyed housing will be more reliable, but they are also likely to underestimate as they won't count people whose homes are intact but who fled for other reasons. Data sources may have reason to alter numbers of reported IDPs, either to increase the amount of assistance received or to decrease international attention or criticism if the event is considered the fault of a government. Whenever possible, multiple sources have been used to verify reported figures. Relatively little sex and age disaggregated data (SADD) is available for most displacement events, as this information is only collected in organized settings such as relief camps. During protracted and neglected crises there are few data sources. Data source definitions are often different from the IDMC's Guiding Principles, and they may use various methodologies. For example, in some countries only IDPs who have been officially registered with the authorities are counted. Sources rarely explain their methodology. Even when multiple sources are available, the IDMC may choose to base estimates on only one source, based on the available sources' coverage and reliability. Oftentimes there are no reported data on the number of displaced people who have sought refuge in urban areas, people hosted by friends or families, or people in remote areas. Returnees are subtracted from the IDP stock without accounting for whether they have found a durable solution. Inclusion of a country in the conflict and violence displacement figures of the Global Report on Internal Displacement depends only on the availability of credible data. The fact that a country is not included does not mean that there is no internal displacement. Some postdisaster IDP estimation methodologies use the average household size and number of damaged or destroyed homes and families in evacuation centers to predict the number of displaced from disasters. The reported number of IDPs is thus heavily dependent on the reliability and consistency of average household size in the affected region.

description: This data set was created by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States and shows bodies of waters that have been identified as impaired based on the current approved Clean Water Act 303(d) lists submitted by states. The goal of the Clean Water Act (CWA) is "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters" (33 U.S.C. §1251(a)). Under section 303(d) of the CWA, states, territories, and authorized tribes, collectively referred to in the act as "states," are required to develop lists of impaired waters. These are waters for which technology-based regulations and other required controls are not stringent enough to meet the water quality standards set by states. The law requires that states establish priority rankings for waters on the lists and develop total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for these waters. A TMDL includes a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that can be present in a waterbody and still meet water quality standards. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: This data set is state-reported; the water quality standards established by each state may be different.

Food security for a region is determined according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification approach. This is a standardized approach to classifying the level of food insecurity in a region. Classifications are typically released 4 times a year, each with a short-term (0-3 months from publication) and medium-term (4-7 months from publication) evaluation of food insecurity at the subnational level.    The approach revolves around a consensus-building process. Food security experts review the available evidence to determine a food security classification on a scale of 1 to 5, with phase 1 corresponding to minimal food insecurity, and phase 5 corresponding to famine-level food insecurity. Evidence used includes satellite data measuring precipitation anomalies (CHIRPS SPI), vegetation anomalies (NDVI), and expert opinion based on knowledge of market and trade functioning and socioeconomic dynamics in each region of interest, among others. The data covers select regions from East, West, and Central Africa, Central America, and Afghanistan. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: FEWS NET uses a scenario development method to evaluate the likelihood of food insecurity events up to 6 months into the future and is not global. Evaluations are based on best possible assumptions concerning the drivers of food security and should not be taken as certain predictions.

description: The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations World Health Organization (WHO), and World Bank Group (WBG) interagency team regularly updates joint global and regional estimates of child malnutrition. These estimates of prevalence and numbers for child stunting, overweight, wasting, and severe wasting are derived by UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), UNICEF, WHO, and World Bank regions, as well as World Bank income group classifications. This data set consists of 806 national survey data that were standardized for purposes of analysis. Estimates are adjusted where necessary to be nationally representative and to cover the age range 0 to 5 years. As a result of making these adjustments, prevalence might be slightly different from the survey results reported elsewhere. UNICEF and WHO receive and review survey data from the published and grey literature as well as reports from national authorities on a continual basis. WHO maintains the WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition (www.who.int/nutgrowthdb), a repository of standardized anthropometric child data which has existed for 20 years (de Onis and Blössner, 2003). UNICEF maintains a global database populated in part through its annual data collection exercise that draws on submissions from more than 150 country offices. Based on these data, with due consideration to potential biases and the views of local experts, UNICEF and WHO developed, and now maintain, a joint analysis dataset of national child malnutrition prevalence estimates for children under-five years of age for all countries or territories annually using available survey data since 1985. Prevalences are based on the WHO Child Growth Standards (WHO, 2006) median for 1) stunting - proportion of children with height-for-age below -2 standard deviations (SD); 2) underweight - proportion of children with weight-for-age below -2 SD; 3) wasting - proportion of children with weight-for-height below -2 SD; 4) overweight - proportion of children with weight-for-height above +2 SD.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: All estimates are presented with 95% confidence intervals to show the level of uncertainty around them. These intervals are important to consider when interpreting estimates. The 95% confidence interval highlights the range within which one can be 95% certain that the true value lies. A wide interval reflects higher uncertainty compared to a narrow one.

description: The Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (FEOW), an updated version of the original dataset produced by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), provides a global biogeographic regionalization of the Earth's freshwater biodiversity. The freshwater major habitat types (MHTs) reflect groupings of ecoregions with similar biological, chemical, and physical characteristics and are roughly equivalent to biomes for terrestrial systems. The MHTs refer to the dynamics of ecological systems and the broad habitat structures that define them within the broad environmental and geographic ecoregion conditions. These groupings can provide a structured framework for examining and comparing the diversity of life in freshwater systems. Covering virtually all freshwater habitats on Earth, this ecoregion map, together with associated species data, is a useful tool for underpinning global and regional conservation planning efforts, particularly to identify outstanding and imperiled freshwater systems; for serving as a logical framework for large-scale conservation strategies; and for providing a global-scale knowledge base for increasing freshwater biogeographic literacy. This version of the FEOW, modified by The Nature Conservancy, includes additional tabular data describing MHTs (similar to terrestrial biomes). The freshwater ecoregion map encompasses 426 units, whose boundaries generally, though not always, correspond with those of watersheds (also known as drainage basins or catchments). Within individual ecoregions there will be turnover of species, such as when moving up or down a river system, but taken as a whole an ecoregion will typically have a distinct evolutionary history and/or ecological processes. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Because of the large scale of ecoregions, all contain patches of multiple habitat types. For instance, ecoregions in the large lakes habitat type can contain swamps, floodplains, and grassy savannas in addition to the dominant lake habitat. Smaller habitats cannot be mapped at the scale of the ecoregion map, but such habitat diversity contributes to species and ecosystem process diversity within ecoregions. For instance, globally 99% of lakes and ponds are less than 10 ha in area. In addition, these MHTs were developed by TNC and the WWF Inc. but have not undergone rigorous review and are as yet unpublished. Ecoregions are delineated based on the best available information, but data describing freshwater species and ecological processes are characterized by marked gaps and variation in quality, and improved information in the future may warrant map revisions.

description: The percentage of the total population living within 100 km of the coastline, created by CIESIN, also includes population living at or below 50 m above sea level. This indicator serves 2 purposes. It quantifies an important driver of coastal ecosystem pressure, and it also quantifies an important component of vulnerability to sea-level rise and other coastal hazards.     Because of the economic benefits that accrue from access to ocean navigation, coastal fisheries, tourism, and recreation, human settlements are often more concentrated in the coastal zone than elsewhere. Presently about 40% of the world’s population lives within 100 km of the coast. As population density and economic activity in the coastal zone increases, pressures on coastal ecosystems increase. Among the most important pressures are habitat conversion, land cover change, pollutant loads, and introduction of invasive species. These pressures can lead to loss of biodiversity, coral reef bleaching, new diseases among organisms, hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, siltation, reduced water quality, and a threat to human health through toxins in fish and shellfish and pathogens such as cholera and hepatitis A residing in polluted water. Finally, it is important to recognize that a high population concentration in the low elevation coastal zone (defined as less than 10 m elevation) increases a country’s vulnerability to sea-level rise and other coastal hazards such as storm surges.    To calculate the percentage of the population within those boundaries requires a disaggregated population data set so that the population within the zone can be distinguished from the rest of the country. Censuses usually offer population data disaggregated subnationally by administrative units, such as regions and districts. These smaller administrative units can be gridded and converted to a raster file, each cell having an equal population. A 100 m buffer can be created from an equidistant map projection of coasts and a low elevation mask from a gridded elevation set. The population within that zone can then be divided by the total country's population and multiplied by 100 to find the percentage. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Users should be cautioned that because land cover and elevation are among the parameters that drive the population allocation model, Landscan (the global population distribution data set used) may be less appropriate as a monitoring tool than population data sets that do not assume a particular relationship between population and these factors.    The spatial detail of census data varied greatly between countries, and 1 km resolution was considered the highest resolution that could be supported globally. The SRTM data utilized was at a resolution of 1 km to facilitate a 1 to 1 spatial match with the population data. By degrading the resolution of the SRTM data to 1 km, the estimates shown likely underestimate the population counts in the zone. A 10 m elevation ceiling was chosen in part because of the error documented in SRTM data precision globally.    The country land area calculations in "country_lecz" worksheet hav been adjusted for the overestimation of urban extents by the nighttime lights data. Globally, the coastal lights were reduced in size by an average of 6 percent when clipped to the coast. The noncoastal lights were also reduced by 6 percent for consistency. The remaining land area was included in the rural land area calculations.    Some areas may be at similar risk to those in coastal zones but are above 50 m in elevation or further than 100 km from the coast. Some population density data are not provided by governments and are sourced elswhere. These data may not be as accurate or detailed as data from national governments. Values of -9999 indicate data are missing.

description: The Yield Gap and Potential Yield for Major Crops data set was created by  EarthStat, University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment and the Land Use (UMN IonE) and Global Environment Lab at the University of British Columbia (LUGE Lab at UBC) for 16 major crops. Yield gaps are defined as the difference between observed crop yields and the potential yield at the same location. Yield gaps were estimated by comparing observed yields to potential yields determined by identifying high-yielding areas within zones, or bins, of similar climate. To classify climates, two parameters were used, which are known to be fundamental drivers of plant growth to describe a region's climate: growing degree days (GDD) and a crop soil moisture index (the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration). For each climate zone and each crop, a table was generated containing the yield, harvest area, and latitude/longitude position information for each grid cell included in the distribution. The data were sorted from the grid cells by their yield values, ranking them from lowest to highest yield. The grid cells' respective harvest areas were then accumulated until arriving at the statistical information of interest: the mean, median, and 90th percentile yields. The percentage of crop's harvested area was calculated to define a percentile yield value. The data draw on average of census data between 1997 to 2003 and are shown as 2000 at a five minute by five minute spatial resolution. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The Global Conflict Risk Index (GCRI), created by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (EC JRC), is an index of the statistical risk of violent conflict in the next 1-4 years for each country in the world. It assumes that structural conditions in a country are linked to the occurrence of violent conflict. The GCRI is exclusively based on quantitative indicators from open source. It is calculated for 24 indicators across 5 dimensions: Political (Regime Type, Lack of Democracy, Government Effectiveness, Level of Repression, Empowerment Rights), Security (Recent Internal Conflict, Neighbors with Highly Violent Conflict, Years since Highly Violent Conflict), Social (Corruption, Ethnic Power Change, Ethnic Compilation, Transnational Ethnic Bonds, Homicide Rate, Infant Mortality), Economy (GDP per Capita, Income Inequality, Openness, Food Security, Unemployment), and Geography and Environment (Water Stress, Oil Production, Structural Constraints, Population Size, Youth Bulge). The GCRI uses a linear regression model including historical data to train the model. Its creators at the JRC first determined the predictive value of the 24 variables regarding conflict onsets in the past 20 years and then applied the results to our final model and derived the weights for our indicators from their significance regarding the model performance. Countries were scored on a 10-point scale for each of the 24 indicators. Data were obtained from open source resources such as the World Bank, United Nations, or Uppsala Data Conlict Program (UCDP). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Although the methodology was developed building on international expertise, no expert judgment or analysis is used in the 6-monthly updates of the GCRI. It is a quantitative method purely based on data processing data. The EC JRC also notes the following limitations: 1) Data in, data out: the model considers only the data. If the source data have errors, are not updated, or are missing, the model output will reflect this. At no point is a judgment or analysis performed at country level; 2) 5 structural risk areas: structural drivers of conflict are simplified in 5 structural risk areas (social, economic, security, political, environmental/structural) associated with violent conflict, with each including 4 or 5 indicators (see explanation below). Potential triggering events are not included in the model (GCRI is not an onset model); 3) Internal conflict: conflicts are grouped in 3 categories: interstate conflicts, conflicts about national power, and subnational conflicts. Currently, only those in the third category are modeled. Interstate conflicts are excluded due to lack of data.

description: The OECD Development Centre’s Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI), created by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is a cross-country measure of discrimination against women in social institutions (formal and informal laws, social norms, and practices) across 160 countries. The SIGI covers five dimensions of discriminatory social institutions, spanning major socioeconomic areas that affect women’s lives: discriminatory family code, restricted physical integrity, son bias, restricted resources and assets, and restricted civil liberties. The SIGI’s variables quantify discriminatory social institutions such as unequal inheritance rights, early marriage, violence against women, and unequal land and property rights.It provides a strong evidence base to more effectively address the discriminatory social institutions that hold back progress on gender equality and women’s empowerment. Each of the SIGI variables is coded between 0, meaning no or very low discrimination, and 1, indicating very high discrimination. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: A single indicator does not capture the overall deprivation of women due to intersecting social institutions, but only reflects one form of discriminatory social institutions. Gender inequality in social institutions appears in many different ways which, while significantly correlated, are not perfect. Hence, a single variable cannot capture the overall phenomena. Moreover, all forms of discriminatory social institutions do not appear simultaneously in all countries covered by the Gender, Institutions, and Development Database (GID-DB). Female genital mutilation mainly occurs in Africa, Egypt and Yemen, while missing women is an Asian-specific issue. A general weakeness of composite indicators is that they lose detailed information, which could lead to simplistic policy conclusions. For in-depth policy analysis, it is suggested that the sub-indices, individual indicators, and variables used in the SIGI be taken into account in addition to the composite index.

description: The forest tenure tool from the Rights and Resources initiative (RRI) displays forest ownership data in 2002 and 2013. This quantitative approach monitors spatial forest tenure data, or who owns how many megahectares (Mha) of a given forest. RRI recognizes 4 categories of land ownership: 1) owned by indigenous peoples and local communities; 2) designated for indigenous peoples and local communities; 3) administered by governments; and 4) owned by individuals and private firms. Global baseline data was collected through a combination of expert consultancies for 48 countries and in-house desk research on 23 countries. Then, the preliminary country data was submitted to people with relevant expertise to verify that the data was as complete as possible and based on the most up-to-date laws and regulations. RRI solicited reviews of country data from more than 900 people globally and collected more than 160 reviews of RRI’s results for individual countries.This statutory forest data set currently covers 52 countries containing nearly 90 percent of the world’s forests. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: This data set does not measure the proportion of forest area that is formally owned. Countries with larger areas will typically display a greater area of formally owned land. All numbers are rounded to the nearest hundredth of a megahectare (Mha).

description: This map of baseline water stress in major crop producing areas was created by WRI's Aqueduct program as part of the Water Risk Atlas, an online mapping tool that displays various aspects of water-related risks. The map displays the major crop producing areas for 13 major commodity crops (cocoa, coffee, cotton, maize, oats, oil palm, oranges, canola, rice, rubber, soybeans, sugarcane, and wheat) and 9 crop groups (cereals, fiber crops, fodder crops, fruits, oil crops, legumes, roots and tubers, sugar crops, and tree nuts), and the levels of water stress (low, low to medium, medium to high, high, and extremely high) experienced in these major crop-producing areas. Baseline water stress refers to the annual water withdrawals (municipal, industrial, and agricultural) expressed as a percentage of the total annual available flow. Higher values indicate more competition among users. Arid areas with low water use are shown in gray but scored as high stress when calculating aggregated scores. Baseline water stress is calculated by dividing water withdrawals (2010) by mean available blue water (1950-2008). Areas with available blue water and water withdrawal less than 0.03 and 0.012/m2 respectively are coded as “arid and low water use." Crop production in each category is computed by overlaying gridded crop production data, which was pulled from 2 articles in Global Biogeochemical Cycle (2008), "Farming the Planet: 1. Geographic Distribution of Global Agricultural Lands in the Year 2000" and "Farming the Planet: 2. Geographic Distribution of Crop Areas, Yields, Physiological Types, and Net Primary Production in the Year 2000." The authors of these studies identified croplands and crop production using a high-resolution satellite-derived land cover data set and agricultural inventory data to derive a global map of croplands. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: In response to growing concerns from private sector actors around water availability, water quality, climate change, and increasing demand, the World Resources Institute developed Aqueduct Global Maps to help decision makers identify areas with higher exposure to water-related risks. Aqueduct employs the composite index approach as a robust communication tool to translate hydrological data into intuitive indicators of water-related risks. 12 indicators were grouped into a framework identifying spatial variation in water risks for 15,006 subcatchments. The 12 global indicators include: baseline water stress, interannual variability, seasonal variability, flood occurrence, drought severity, upstream storage, groundwater stress, return flow ratio, upstream protected land, media coverage, access to water, and threatened amphibians, grouped into 3 categories of risk (physical quantity, quality, and regulatory and reputational risk) and 1 overall score. For 6 of the 12 indicators, an ensemble of time series estimators, spatial regression, and a sparse hydrological model was used to generate novel datasets of water supply and use. The remaining six indicators were adapted from existing publications. Aggregation methods were chosen to maximize transparency and communicability, and to allow for dynamic weighting to reflect different users’ sensitivities to water-related risks. Catchments with less than 0.012 m/m2/year of withdrawal and 0.03 m/m2 /year of available blue water were masked out as “arid and low water use”.   Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: These global indicators are best suited for comparative analyses across large geographies to identify regions or assets deserving of closer attention, and are not appropriate for catchment or site-specific analyses. At the composite index level, the selection of aggregation methods is an inherently subjective process that creates value by simplifying complex phenomena. Validation of the composite index of water risk is a challenge because of the difficulty of collecting risk-event data. Other possible water-related risks also escape the index. The complex and qualitative nature of regulatory and reputational drivers of risk complicates researchers’ ability to create useful metrics. Barriers, such as inconsistent availability of data, as well as the unwillingness or lack of capacity for governments to collect and share water data, hamper the construction of consistent global water information. Water infrastructure is likewise undermeasured, as there are no published global datasets of major water transfer projects, infrastructural losses, or reservoir evaporation. Similarly, methods for evaluating freshwater ecosystem services such as flood attenuation and pollution control at the global scale remain underdeveloped.

description: The Global Gender Gap report, released by the World Economic Forum annually since 2006, quantifies gender equality by the relative gaps between women and men across 4 key areas (health, education, economy, and politics) rated in 144 countries. The index focuses on measuring gaps rather than levels, captures gaps in outcome variables rather than gaps in input variables, and ranks countries according to gender equality rather than women’s empowerment. To construct the index, all data are converted to female-to-male ratios and truncated at the equality benchmark of 1 to assign the same score to a country that has reached parity between women and men and one where women have surpassed men. Health indicators are truncated at different values. The third step in the process involves calculating the weighted average of the indicators within each subindex to create the subindex scores. Averaging the different indicators would implicitly give more weight to the measure that exhibits the largest variability or standard deviation. The indicators were first normalized by equalizing their standard deviations. This way of weighting indicators ensures that each indicator has the same relative impact on the subindex. For of all subindexes, the highest possible score is 1 (parity) and the lowest possible score is 0 (imparity), thus binding the scores between inequality and equality benchmarks. An unweighted average of each subindex score is used to calculate the overall Global Gender Gap Index score. Similar to subindex scores, this final value ranges between 1 (parity) and 0 (imparity), thus allowing for comparisons relative to ideal standards of equality in addition to relative country rankings. The parity and imparity benchmarks remain fixed across time, allowing the reader to track individual country progress in relation to an ideal standard of equality. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The magnitude of gender gaps in countries around the world is the combined result of various socio-economic, policy and cultural variables. The Global Gender Gap Index was developed in 2006 partially to address the need for a consistent and comprehensive measure for gender equality that can track a country’s progress over time. The Index does not seek to set priorities for countries but rather to provide a comprehensive set of data and a clear method for tracking gaps on critical indicators so that countries may set priorities within their own economic, political and cultural contexts.

description: From production and consumption of wood products to income generation, forests provide multiple benefits to communities around the globe. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) compiles country-level statistics on gross value added (GVA) from the formal forest sector as well as its contribution to employment and gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 as part of the 2014 State of the Forests report. Information from subsectors of roundwood production, wood processing, and pulp and paper are included. Income from forestry and forest-related activities includes the wages, profits and timber revenue earned in the formal sector, plus the income earned in informal activities, such as production of wood fuel and non-wood forest products. FAO uses gross value added as a measure of the income generated from activities in the forest sector. GVA is the sum of all revenue earned in the sector, minus the cost of all purchases from other sectors. Employment in the formal forest sector is presented as its total number and as the share of total workforce employed. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Problems with underevaluation and lack of detail in national forestry statistics, as well as the higher-quality data available for developed regions as opposed to developing ones, make it difficult to assess data quality. The authors of the FAO report were particularly concerned that the national statistics on employment were not converting the employment statistics to full-time equivalents. In order to be consistent with the methodology used in past reports, this data set only takes into account activities in the formal forestry sector and their direct economic impacts on national economies.

Underlying the Bonn Challenge is the forest landscape restoration (FLR) approach, which aims to restore ecological integrity at the same time as improving human well-being through multifunctional landscapes. The Bonn Challenge is not a new global commitment but rather a practical means of realizing many existing international commitments, including the CBD Aichi Target 15, the UNFCCC REDD+ goal, and the Rio+20 land degradation neutrality goal. It is an implementation vehicle for national priorities such as water and food security and rural development while contributing to the achievement of international climate change, biodiversity and land degradation commitments.

description: The Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) data set identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of forest extent that show no signs of significant human activity and are large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well as verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. These were then mapped from Landsat satellite imagery for the year 2000. Changes in the extent of IFLs were identified within year 2000 IFL boundary using the global wall-to-wall Landsat image composite for year 2013 and the global forest cover loss dataset (Hansen et al., 2013). Areas identified as “reduction in extent” met the IFL criteria in 2000, but no longer met the criteria in 2013. The main causes of change were clearing for agriculture and tree plantations, industrial activity such as logging and mining, fragmentation due to infrastructure and new roads, and fires assumed to be caused by humans. This data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The world IFL map was created through visual interpretation of Landsat images by experts. The map may contain inaccuracies due to limitations in the spatial resolution of the imagery and lack of ancillary information about local land-use practices in some regions. In addition, the methodology assumes that fires in proximity to roads or other infrastructure may have been caused by humans and therefore constitute a form of anthropogenic disturbance. This assumption could result in an underestimation of IFL extent in the boreal biome.

description: The Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) and the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) created the Global Distribution of Infant Mortality maps as part of their Gridded Poverty Mapping project. This data set is also known as Global Infant Mortality Rates (IMRs). IMRs are a useful proxy for overall poverty levels because they are highly correlated with metrics such as income, education levels, and health status of the population. IMRs are particularly good for distinguishing poverty levels at low income levels. IMRs are reported as the rate of children who die before reaching 1 year old for every 1,000 live births. Sources of data for the Global IMR map include Demographic and Health Surveys (39 countries), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (5 countries), National Human Development Reports (14 countries), and National Statistical Offices (18 countries). 115 countries had national-level data only, from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). 36 countries had no data. Brazil and Mexico had data for a total of 5,372 administrative units. 74 other countries had subnational data, with an average of 22 units per country. Subnational IMR values were adjusted to be consistent with national UNICEF 2000 IMR values. These data are available as a spatial grid, downsampled using a proportional allocation algorithm. Data are available for the year 2000. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The data underlying these infant mortality rate estimates are based on survey results, which may not be truly representative of the administrative regions they are ascribed to. These data are now quite outdated (over 17 years old), but they constitute one of the only recognized subnational data sets for global infant mortality rates.

description: The Gender Development Index (GDI), published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), measures gender gaps in human development achievements by accounting for disparities between women and men in 3 basic dimensions of human development using the same component indicators as in the Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable, and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the 3 dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth; the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school-entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing gross national income (GNI). The scores for the 3 HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. The GDI is the ratio of the HDIs calculated separately for females and males using the same methodology as in the HDI. It is a direct measure of gender gap, showing the female HDI as a percentage of the male HDI. The GDI is calculated for 161 countries in 2015 and shows how much women are lagging behind their male counterparts in each dimension of human development. It facilitates understanding of the real gender gap in human development achievements and is useful in designing policy tools to close the gap.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The HDI/GDI simplifies and captures only part of what human development entails. It does not reflect on inequalities, poverty, human security, empowerment, etc.  Although updated annually, there maybe a delay in the release of data from the previous year.

description: The Food Footprint by Type (Protein) data set was produced by the World Resources Institute in their 2016 working paper, Shifting Diets for a Sustainable Food Future, and illustrates the variations in impact ("footprint") of various food products on land use, freshwater use, and greenhouse gas emissions, per ton of protein consumed. Land use is separated into cropland use and pasture land use. Freshwater use is specified as either from rainwater or irrigation. Greenhouse gas emissions are categorized as occurring during land-use change (e.g., converting forested land to pasture or cropland) or during agricultural production. The impact is measured by the hectares used, thousand cubic meters of freshwater used, or tons of carbon dioxide equivalent produced per ton of protein consumed. Both plant-based and animal-based food products are examined in this data set. The plant-based products examined are wheat, rice, maize, pulses, and roots and tubers, and the animal-based products are food pork, eggs, fish (farmed, includes all aquatic animal products), poultry, dairy, and beef.  The data used in this data set are global means for land use, water use, and GHG emissions and were derived from the GlobAgri model (land use and greenhouse gas emissions), the authors’ calculations from Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011, 2012) (freshwater consumption), and Waite et al. (2014) (farmed fish freshwater consumption). Freshwater use for farmed fish products is shown as rainwater and irrigation combined. Land use and greenhouse gas emissions estimates are based on a marginal analysis (i.e., additional agricultural land use and emissions per additional million calories or ton of protein consumed). Based on the approach taken by the European Union for estimating emissions from land-use change for biofuels, land-use change impacts are amortized over a period of 20 years and then shown as annual impacts. Land use and greenhouse gas emissions estimates for beef production are based on dedicated beef production, not beef that is a coproduct of dairy. Tons of harvested products were converted to quantities of calories and protein using the global average edible calorie and protein contents of food types as reported in the Food and Agriculture Organization's FAOSTAT (2015).

Land use is separated into cropland use and pasture land use. Freshwater use is specified as either from rainwater or irrigation. Greenhouse gas emissions are categorized as occurring during land-use change (e.g., converting forested land to pasture or cropland) or during agricultural production. The impact is measured by the hectares used, thousand cubic meters of freshwater used, or tons of carbon dioxide equivalent produced per million of kilocalories consumed. Both plant-based and animal-based food products are examined in this data set. The plant-based products examined are sugar, rice, rapeseed and mustard seed oil, maize, roots and tubers, wheat, soybean oil, fruits and vegetables, sunflower seed oil, and pulses; the animal-based products are pork, eggs, fish (farmed, includes all aquatic animal products), poultry, dairy, and beef. The data set clearly illustrates that animal products overwhelmingly use more land and water, and produce greater quantities of greenhouse gas emissions, than plant-based products. The data used in this data set are global means for land use, water use, and GHG emissions and were derived from the GlobAgri model (land use and greenhouse gas emissions), authors’ calculations from Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011, 2012) (freshwater consumption), and Waite et al.

description: The World Assessment of Undiscovered Oil and Gas Resources released by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 2012 estimates the value of undiscovered petroleum resources around the globe. The methodology for the assessment included a complete geologic framework description for each province based mainly on published literature, and the definition of petroleum systems and assessment units (AUs) within these systems. In this study, 313 AUs were defined and assessed for undiscovered oil and gas accumulations. Exploration and discovery history was a critical part of the methodology to determine sizes and numbers of undiscovered accumulations. In those AUs with few or no discoveries, geologic and production analogs were used as a partial guide to estimate sizes and numbers of undiscovered oil and gas accumulations, using a database developed by the USGS following the 2000 assessment (Charpentier et al. 2008). Each AU was assessed for undiscovered oil and nonassociated gas accumulations, and coproduct ratios were used to calculate the volumes of associated gas (gas in oil fields) and volumes of natural gas liquids.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The Maritime Boundaries available for download on Marine Regions were created by the Flanders Marine Institute. Marine Regions makes available all areas included in the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). These areas are exclusive economic zones, territorial seas, contiguous zones, internal waters, and archipelagic waters. The maritime boundaries and areas are calculated from the baselines. In the Maritime Boundaries data set, the baselines used were a combination of a coastline as a proxy for the low-water line (the normal baseline described in UNCLOS) and straight or archipelagic baselines. The source for the straight baselines was primarily the UN repository of all the claims from UNCLOS’s signatories: Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea (DOALOS). In addition to this main source, others were also used to complete the straight baselines database, such as national legislation on maritime delimitations, agreements, treaties, and the US Department of State, among others. Esri Countries 2014 was the primary source for the Maritime Boundaries version 9 baseline. The coastline was extracted from Esri Countries 2014 and then combined with reefs data extracted from Coral Reef Distribution UNEP for the countries where reefs were fundamental for the correct calculation of the maritime areas, as intended by the coastal state. Several other fixes were made to the coastline to ensure that the coastline could be used as an appropriate normal baseline for the drawing of the multiple Maritime Boundaries areas. The seaward outermost boundaries of 200, 12, and 24 nautical miles represent the hypothetical outer limit of the exclusive economic zones, territorial seas, and contiguous zones, respectively. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The HydroLAKES database provides a seamless high-resolution map of the world’s lakes and their main characteristics in support of a broad range of global-scale assessments and analyses, with a focus on improving users’ ability to model the important roles that lakes play in the global environment. The HydroLAKES database was designed as a digital map repository to include all lakes with a surface area of at least 10 ha. The current version comprises the shoreline polygons of 1,427,688 individual lakes. HydroLAKES aims to be as comprehensive and consistent as possible at a global scale and contains both freshwater and saline lakes, including the Caspian Sea, as well as human-made reservoirs and regulated lakes. The HydroLAKES database was created by compiling, correcting, and unifying several near-global and regional data sets. Map generalization methods were applied and some polygon outlines were smoothed during the mapping process to ensure spatial consistency of the data. The resulting map scale is estimated to be between 1:100,000 and 1:250,000 for most lakes globally, with some coarser ones at 1:1 million. To enhance the attribute information provided by HydroLAKES, a spatial coregistration to the global river network database HydroSHEDS was established. Literature estimates of lake depths and/or volumes were compiled for all lakes ≥ 500 km2. To predict average lake depths and volumes for smaller lakes, a geostatistical model based on surrounding land surface topography was developed. The addition of high-resolution discharge data allowed the estimation of hydraulic residence times for each lake. All natural lakes of the HydroLAKES database show a combined surface area of 2.67 x 106 km2 (1.8% of global land area), a total shoreline length of 7.2 x 106 km (about 4 times longer than the world’s ocean coastline), and a total volume of 181.9 x 103 km3 (0.8% of total global nonfrozen terrestrial water stocks). Mean and median hydraulic residence times for all lakes were computed to be 1,834 days and 451 days, respectively. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: It should be noted that nearly all data sets used in the development of HydroLAKES were either generated by radar technology (SWBD), analysis of long-term imagery composites (MODIS), or were based on topographic maps (e.g., CanVec, US NHD). The effect of clouds is only minor on these types of remote sensing imagery, and absent for topographic maps. While HydroLAKES is assumed to achieve complete coverage of larger lakes, discrepancies with other existing lake data sets may be due to varying definitions of what constitutes a lake as opposed to a river or wetland. Also, some lakes may have changed in their extent (or even disappeared) in recent times, or undergone strong seasonal fluctuations that are not properly represented by the temporal snapshot provided in HydroLAKES. Finally, there may be some confusion in interpreting connected pools in close vicinity as one or multiple lakes. As a prominent example, Lakes Michigan and Huron have been split into two lakes—despite their natural connection—in order to conform with the general convention of treating them as separate units. The level of completeness of HydroLAKES at the lower size limit of 10 ha is difficult to verify. Messager et al. (2016) provide a statistical extrapolation toward smaller lakes which indicates that HydroLAKES achieves virtually full completion for lakes above 35 ha and close to full completion for lakes between 10 and 35 ha.

description: The Environmental Performance Index (EPI), produced by Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), Data-Driven Yale and Columbia University Earth Institute Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CEISIN), scores countries from 0 to 100 according to each country's relative performance on a set of environmental indicators. A score of 100 means that the country ranks above a high-quality benchmark for all its indicators. A score of 0 means that the country ranks below some low-quality benchmark for all its indicators. The index is built from 19 national-level indicators relevant to environmental issues, grouped into 9 issues, which are themselves divided between 2 overarching themes: 1) ecosystem vitality and 2) environmental health as it applies to human health. Multiple other data sets were employed to provide context before whittling down to those 19. Each country's score for each indicator is scaled between 0 and 100 to reflect the proximity of its score in that indicator to a high-quality benchmark. The high-quality benchmark can either be a statistical measure---such as the 95th percentile of the distribution of all countries' scores---or a scientifically determined target, such as the World Health Organization's designation of safe and dangerous amounts of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) in the air we breathe. The 19 indicators, each scored been 0 and 100, are then combined with each other to produce the overall EPI score for a country. The indicators are weighted differently depending on the relative reliability of the data that underpins them. A "materiality threshold" is used to determine whether an indicator should count toward a given country's score. Landlocked countries, for example, are not rated according to their marine protected areas or the health of their fisheries. When these indicators are removed, the remaining indicators receive proportionally higher weights in calculating the country total EPI. The EPI uses both primary and secondary data. Primary data come from human-administered surveys or technological monitoring schemes, including data derived from satellites. Secondary data include country-collected statistics, but only when those statistics are submitted to an independent international organization that enforces data reporting and quality requirements. Modeled data are also included. The 2016 global data set is retrieved from the Global Metrics for the Environment – 2016 Environmental Performance Index Report.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Data are not available for all countries, for all indicators, for all years. The EPI team would like to include several indicators for which data is not available at scale. These include freshwater quality, species loss, indoor air quality of residential and commercial buildings, toxic chemical exposures, municipal solid waste management, nuclear safety, wetlands loss, agricultural soil quality and degradation, recycling rates, and adaptation, vulnerability, and resilience to climate change.    The relevance of the EPI to comparing countries depends on the quality of data collected for each indicator. Not all countries collected detailed subnational statistics, such as documenting the water treatment technologies used in rural and remote areas. Before using the EPI and the indicators contained within it for policy purposes, users are encouraged to read the EPI 2016 report to determine the sources and limitations of data underlying each indicator.

description: The Environmental Democracy Index (EDI) was developed by The Access Initiative (TAI) and World Resources Institute (WRI) in collaboration with partners around the world. The index evaluates 70 countries, across 75 legal indicators, based on objective and internationally recognized standards established by the Bali Guidelines of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Legal indicators test both the extent of provisions that promote environmental democracy and the strength of a given provision in providing an enforceable legal right for the public. Each of these indicators is scored on a range from 0 (lowest) to 3 (highest). A score of 3 means that the respective provision exemplifies accepted good practice. A score of 2 indicates that a majority—but not all—of environmental decision making includes a certain provision, or indicates moderately strong provision. A score of 1 translates to a weaker provision that allows significant discretion to government agencies to fulfil these rights, or that a right only applies to a minority of environmental decision making processes. A score of 0 indicates that the law is either silent or prohibits some aspect of procedural rights, depending on the indicator. The overall EDI score is the average of the scores of the 75 legal indicators. The EDI also includes a supplemental set of 24 limited practice indicators that provide insight on a country’s performance in implementation. The national laws and practices were assessed and scored by more than 140 lawyers around the world. Country assessments were conducted in 2014 and will be updated every 2 years. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: While EDI assesses the content of a country’s constitution, freedom of information laws, major environmental legislation across several sectors, and case law where appropriate, it does not provide a comprehensive measurement of implementation of the law, nor does it assess laws at the subnational level. Biases have been reduced to the extent possible within the adopted research method. Separate evaluation of the indicators, sources, explanations, and scores were conducted by 2 local lawyers independent of each other. These evaluations were reviewed by WRI staff, with further reviews by civil society groups in the TAI network and by governments. All of these steps help to reduce bias. However, other safeguards, such a double blind scoring by the first 2 local lawyers, were not applied. Additionally, each legal culture has approaches to legislation and its interpretation. Broadly the common law, civil law, law in the former Soviet bloc, and Islamic juridical traditions may differ in the way they approach legislation, its content, import, and interpretation. The method adopted respects these individual juridical traditions and looks only to whether the elements searched for in each indicator are present within the meaning of that country’s tradition. As such it is not possible to standardize legislative language approaches or interpretation across all countries, and local juridical approaches are present in scoring and reasoning.

description: Crop Harvested Area and Production data set was created by EarthStat, University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment (UMN IonE) and Land Use and Global Environment Lab at the University of British Columbia (LUGE Lab at UBC). It shows the harvested area, yield and production amount of 175 crops in 206 countries for the year 2000 (average of census data betweeen 1997-2003). Harvested area represents the fractional proportion of hectares harvested per gridcell. Production is calculated by multiplying harvested area in hectares and crop yield in tons per hectare. The data was collected from agricultural census and survey information on the areas and yields of 175 crops from the smallest political units reasonably obtainable for 206 countries. Data availability varies for different crops within each country, with most countries having subnational statistics for some crops but national statistics for others. The largest single source of subnational data is Agro-MAPS, a joint project between the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Food Policy Research Institute, and the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment. Croplands cover about 15 million km² of the planet and provide the bulk of the food and fiber essential to human well-being. Most global land cover data sets from satellites group croplands into just a few categories, thereby excluding information critical for answering key questions on subjects ranging from biodiversity conservation to food security to biogeochemical cycling. Information about agricultural land use practices like crop selection, yield, and fertilizer use is even more limited. These EarthStat data present land use data sets created by combining national, state, and county-level census statistics with a recently updated global data set of croplands on a 5 minute by 5 minute (~10 km by 10 km) latitude/longitude grid. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: These data sets are not intended to be interpreted at the individual grid cell level. The best way to use these maps is to compare counties, states regions, countries, or continents. Due to the nature of agricultural statistics, the major crop data are more reliable than the data for minor crops. Only crop harvested area and production data for maize, wheat, rice and soybean are displayed. A grid cell may exceed 1.0 or 100% due to multiple harvests per year.

description: The Terrestrial Ecoregions data released by The Nature Conservatory, and updated in 2008, from compilations of previous studies classify land into a total of 14 major habitat types (MHTs).  MHTs reflect groupings of ecoregions with similar biological, chemical, and physical characteristics. The MHTs refer to the dynamics of ecological systems and the broad habitat structures that define them, and these groupings can provide a structured framework for examining and comparing the diversity of life in terrestrial systems. MHTs are broadly broken down by latitude, ranging from boreal and tundra, temperature, and tropical regions. Temperate and tropical forests are further broken down into broadleaf and conifers. These regions are also distinguished by moisture level, ranging from desert and xeric, dry, and moist habitats. Finally, shrublands are distinguished by elevation, from high altitude montane shrublands to flooded lowlands. The ecoregions were originally developed by Olson and Dinerstein (2002), Bailey (1995), and Environment Canada (Wiken 1986), and modified by The Nature Conservancy (TNC).  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: First defined in 1988 by scientist Norman Myers, biodiversity hotspots are areas characterized by high levels of endemic plants coupled with significant habitat loss. Specifically, a region must meet the following criteria to achieve Conservation International’s hotspot classification: 1) At least 1,500 species of vascular plants (>0.5% of the world’s total) are endemic; 2) At least 70% of the original natural vegetation has been lost. When Myers first defined the term, he identified 10 tropical forest hotspots. The need to pinpoint priority conservation regions led Conservation International (CI) to adopt the term and reassess the hotspot concept. In this process, CI introduced quantitative thresholds (see above) and added additional regions. At that time, there were 25 hotspots. Because of the constant change in environmental threats and the improved understanding of biodiversity, CI has since revisited the hotspots to refine boundaries, update information, and add new regions to create this global dataset. This process produced an additional 10 hotspots, bringing the total to 35. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW), produced by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and modified in 2007, represents broad-scale patterns of species and communities in the ocean, and was designed as a tool for planning conservation across a range of scales and assessing conservation efforts and gaps worldwide. This new biogeographic classification for the world’s coastal and shelf areas draws heavily on the existing global and regional literature. The authors reviewed 230 works in journals, NGO reports, government publications, and other sources to classify these regions.  The current system focuses on coast and shelf areas and does not consider realms in pelagic or deep benthic environment. The ecoregional classification relates primarily to coast and shelf biotas for which a 200 m depth contour is a indicative boundary.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The shapefile does not accurately represent outer MEOW boundaries: As specified in the original publications, the boundaries in this shapefile have been extended out some 200 nautical miles from land (and this buffer is extended to include any additional marine areas less than 200 m in depth which lie beyond this distance). This outer boundary buffer is primarily drawn here to ease visibility of ecoregions in global and regional scale maps. Similarly, the inland boundaries of the ecoregions extend far inland---a convention to ensure inclusion of any coastline and estuarine/lagoonal systems that may be derived from different map sources. As specified, the ecoregional classification relates primarily to coast and shelf biotas for which a 200 m depth contour is a more accurate indicative boundary. It is therefore not an appropriate use of the data to calculate total ecoregion areas or generate other area or volumetric dependent statistics using these boundaries alone.

description: The Roadless Areas data set was created by Ibisch at al. from 2013 OpenStreetMap roads data. A 1 km buffer was applied to all roads to create a global map of roadless areas. The data also include an assessment of the roadless areas' status, quality, and extent of coverage by protected areas.  Roads fragment landscapes and trigger human colonization and degradation of ecosystems, to the detriment of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. The planet’s remaining large and ecologically important tracts of roadless areas sustain key refugia for biodiversity and provide globally relevant ecosystem services.  About 80% of Earth’s terrestrial surface remains roadless, but this area is fragmented into ~600,000 patches, more than half of which are less than 1 square kilometer and only 7% of which are larger than 100 square kilometers. Global protection of ecologically valuable roadless areas is inadequate. International recognition and protection of roadless areas is urgently needed to halt their continued loss. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Given the pace of road construction and data limitations, the results overestimate the actual extent of global roadless areas.

description: While many bird species are widespread, over 2,500 are endemic and restricted to an area smaller than 5 million ha (restricted-range species). BirdLife International has mapped every restricted-range species using georeferenced locality records. Through this process, it identified 218 regions of the world—known as endemic bird areas (EBAs)—where the distributions of 2 or more of these species overlap.    Half of all restricted-range species are globally threatened or near-threatened, and the other half remain vulnerable to loss or degradation of habitat. The majority of EBAs are also important for the conservation of restricted-range species from other animal and plant groups. The unique landscapes where these bird species occur, amounting to just 4.5% of the Earth's land surface, are high priorities for broad-scale ecosystem conservation.    Geographically, EBAs are often islands or mountain ranges, and vary considerably in size, from a few hundred ha to more than 10 million ha. EBAs also vary in the number of restricted-range species that they support (from 2 to 80). EBAs are found around the world, but most (77%) of them are located in the tropics and subtropics. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The number of EBAs having a combination of severe/major habitat loss and a small proportion (0–20%) of threatened/extinct restricted-range species is fewer than would occur by chance. This is perhaps because habitat loss has been used to infer threatened status of some poorly known species in some of these EBAs. Approximately two-thirds of the 218 EBAs are not well-sampled: 50% of EBAs are judged to be incompletely known and 17% are considered to be poorly known.

description: The Anthropogenic Biomes data set, created by the Anthromes Working Group, illustrates historical transformations within the terrestrial biosphere that are caused by sustained direct human interaction with ecosystems. Anthromes, also known as Anthropogenic Biomes, are globally significant ecological patterns created by sustained interactions between humans and ecosystems. The data set reclassifies the terrestrial biosphere into 19 anthrome classes at 5 degree resolution for the years 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 to illustrate historical changes. The classification used a rule-based anthrome classification model based on human population density and land use data. The transformation of terrestrial biomes is then assessed by comparing potential natural vegetation maps with anthrome maps using overlay analysis and other analytical geographic information system (GIS) software tools. The anthrome classes included in this data set are urban (urban, mixed settlements), villages (rice villages, irrigated villages, rainfed villages, pastoral villages), croplands (residential irrigated croplands, residential rainfed croplands, populated rainfed croplands, remote croplands), rangelands (residential rangelands, populated rangelands, remote rangelands), forested (residential woodlands, populated woodlands, remote woodlands, inhabited treeless and barren lands), and woodlands (wild woodlands, wild treeless and barren lands). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Land use is classified into different categories at a given value of a variable, even when they may differ only slightly.

description: Accessibility to Cities data set, created by the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP), quantifies global accessibility to high-density urban centers via surface transport at a resolution of 1 km for 2015. The source includes gridded surfaces that quantify the geographical positions and salient attributes of roads, railways, rivers, water bodies, land cover types, topographical conditions (slope angle and elevation) and national borders. Assumptions are made about travel times over each method of transportation, including infrastructure such as roads and railways and open land such as forests and plains. The roads dataset was created by merging Open Street Map (OSM) data with a distance-to-roads product derived from the Google roads database from November 2016 and March 2016, respectively. The nearest urban center is defined as a contiguous area with 1,500 or more inhabitants per square kilometer or a majority of built-up land cover coincident with a population center of at least 50,000 inhabitants. The cities are identified using the above assumption based on the Global Human Settlement Grid of high-density land cover (GHS-HDC) data set. Because cities are typically clusters of many cells rather than individual points, they are effectively treated as polygons when calculating travel time from a given point. The accessibility surface map is generated using the cumulative cost function within Google Earth Engine. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The Annual Surface Water Extent data set contains maps of the location and temporal distribution of surface water from 1984 to 2015 and provides statistics on the extent and change of those water surfaces. For more information see the associated journal article: High-resolution mapping of global surface water and its long-term changes (Nature, 2016) and the online Data Users Guide. These data were generated using 3,066,102 scenes from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 acquired between 16 March 1984 and 10 October 2015. Each pixel was individually classified into water / non-water using an expert system and the results were collated into a monthly history for the entire time period and two epochs (1984-1999, 2000-2015) for change detection. The Yearly Seasonality Classification collection contains a year-by-year classification of the seasonality of water based on the occurrence values detected throughout the year. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Any bodies of water smaller than 30-m resolution are not be recognized. Similarly, bodies of water obscured by vegetation or built infrastructure are not recognized. Gaps in the image archives due to cloud cover or sensor failure can lead to instances of surface water being missed. Not all regions of the world are represented from the beginning of this data set in 1984. For example, parts of Siberia and Kolyma were not included in the image record until 1999 and 1995, respectively. The data were checked for errors of omission (not labeling a pixel as water when it was) and for errors of commission (labeling a pixel as water when it was not), and some of these errors were corrected. Some errors remain, partly due to errors of commission stemming from needing improved urban area and infrastructural information to help train the decision algorithms not to confuse built areas for water. A failure of Landsat 7's scan line corrector (SLC) caused the loss of about 22% of each scene, resulting in fragmented images. This occasionally led to potentially confusing results, which can be identified as sections of the water occurrence maps having a "slatted appearance."

description: This Global Landslide Susceptibility Map, created by scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and published in 2017 at 1 km resolution, improves upon past landslide susceptibility maps by incorporating the most up-to-date data. NASA scientists evaluated landslide susceptibility on slope from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and forest loss from a Landsat-based record of forest change compiled by a University of Maryland team. They also included data on key factors including the presence of roads from OpenStreetMap, the strength of bedrock and soils, and the locations of faults from the Geological Map of the World, 3rd ed., by Philippe Bouysse (2009). They generated the map using a heuristic fuzzy approach that generated the possibility of landslides and validated it through landslide inventories. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: A disadvantage of a heuristic fuzzy approach to the creation of the map is that the output is a “possibility,” which is not strictly comparable to the probabilities generated by classical statistics; several features of the map thus may limit its use. First, the resolution of the map is approximately 1 km, and terrain varies significantly within many pixels. The choice to aggregate slope by computing the maximum value means that some pixels may contain a very small area of steep terrain, while the remainder is not susceptible to landslides. Second, the use of biased and incomplete landslide inventories to evaluate the susceptibility map makes the results more difficult to interpret. Third, the Geological Map of the World is only appropriate for use over very large areas. At local and national scales, more detailed information is often available, but it varies in quality, format, and cost. Fourth, this map models all mass movements with the same treatment. The real world is more complex, and factors that drive rock toppling in Canada are not the same as those which can cause debris flows in New Guinea. Fifth, this map does not provide an explicit hazard level in the form of an annual probability of slope failure. Therefore it is very likely that landslides will occur at some date in all of the very highly susceptible locations, but the size, frequency, and timing of those events are not known. These limitations suggest that the global susceptibility map is best used for a few purposes: situational awareness of global landslide hotspots and potential occurrence, the development of global decision support systems, and prioritization of future landslide research. It is not appropriate for decisions about infrastructure design, building code legislation, or local land use planning.

description: Climate Hazard InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)-SPI data are produced using CHIRPS data from the Climate Hazards Group at UCSB and use statistical methods (described below) to identify when precipitation is above or below normal for each cell in a 0.05° grid of the world between 50°S-50°N (and all longitudes). This information can be used in early warning systems to identify anomalous precipitation that could lead to droughts or floods.    The base CHIRPS incorporates 0.05° resolution satellite imagery with on-the-ground precipitation station data to create gridded rainfall time series, measured in mm of precipitation/time period. Satellite data are derived from both microwave and infrared sensors. On-the-ground precipitation station data come from the Agromet Group of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN). A detailed description of the methodology behind CHIRPS can be found in this Nature article: http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201566 http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ds832.    When new precipitation data are released, an SPI is calculated for each grid cell. The result is a global grid of the same resolution as the precipitation data, with the units of data in that grid converted from mm of precipitation into standard deviations away from the seasonal mean. At least 30 years of historical precipitation data should be used to determine the median rainfall amount and the variability of rainfall for each cell over the chosen time frame, and these values are then used to convert the new precipitation data into the SPI.     Resource Watch features SPIs calculated over 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, or 12-month time frames. SPIs of differing time frames will correlate to different degrees with other observed phenomena, as is explored in this article: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2150704X.2016.1264020. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: 2 CHIRPS products are produced operationally: a rapid preliminary version and a later final version. The preliminary CHIRPS product is available, for the entire domain, 2 days after the end of a pentad (2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th, 22nd, and 27th of the month). The preliminary CHIRPS uses two station sources: GTS and Mexico. The final CHIRPS product takes advantage of several other station sources and is complete sometime in the 3rd week of the following month. Final products for all times/domains/formats are calculated at that time.
functions: Standardized index of the degree to which recent rainfall has been above or below seasonal trends for a given region.

description: The "Earth at Night" map images were generated by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) using the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite, managed by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Suomi NPP observes nearly every location on Earth at roughly 1:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. (local time) each day, as it images the planet in vertical 3,000 km (2,000-mile) strips from pole to pole. The satellite’s workhorse instrument is the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which detects photons of light reflected from the Earth’s surface and atmosphere in 22 different wavelengths. The final Earth at Night products show the areas of man-made visible and infrared light in the world at night, excluding moonlight, fires, and other natural sources of light. Areas with the brightest light points tend to be population centers and are often located in coastal areas. Earth at Night maps are available for the years 2012 and 2016, in both color and grayscale, in both JPEG and GeoTIFF formats and with resolution from 500 m to 3 km. The 2016 images were processed using a compositing technique that selected the best cloud-free nights in each month over each land mass. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.

description: Projected permafrost extents, created through the research of Chadburn et al. (2017), estimates a sensitivity of permafrost area loss to global mean warming at stabilization of 2°C. The latest climate models all predict warming of high-latitude soils and thus thawing of permafrost under future climate change, but with widely varying magnitudes of permafrost thaw. It is estimated that permafrost area will eventually be reduced by over 40% if the climate is stabilized at 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This research showed that it is possible to infer the sensitivity of permafrost to future global warming by using present-day spatial distribution of permafrost and mean annual air temperature (MAAT). Permafrost extent is estimated at a 0.5 degree spatial resolution and is restricted to the northern hemisphere.   Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The robustness of this approach depends on the extent to which this relationship between permafrost area and air temperature remains consistent under climate change. In addition, this approach calculates the committed permafrost distribution for each global mean temperature. During a period of warming, the actual changes in permafrost area will lag behind this quasi-equilibrium state, due to the long timescale of warming for the deep ground.

description: The Global Grid of Probabilities of Urban Expansion to 2030 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (NASA SEDAC) presents spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land cover change from 2000 to 2030 at a 2.5 arc-minute resolution. For each grid cell that is nonurban in 2000, a Monte Carlo model assigned a probability of becoming urban by the year 2030. The authors first extracted urban extent circa 2000 from the NASA MODIS Land Cover Type Product, version 5, which provides a conservative estimate of global urban land cover. The authors then used population densities from the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, version 1 (GRUMP v1), to create the population density driver map. They estimated the amount of new urban land in each United Nations region by 2030 in a Monte Carlo fashion based on present empirical distribution of regional urban population densities and probability density functions of projected regional population and GDP values for 2030.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The data are valid for exploring patterns and dynamics over large regions. It is not advisable to use the data to draw conclusions about any one locality. These data therefore are not recommended for use in analyses of small areas. They are best used for analyses over broader areas. Although regions were not excluded in the creation of these data, some small urban areas, such as Tromso and Norilsk, are missing. This is a result of resampling the input land-cover data from 463 meters to 5 kilometers.

description: The Aboveground Live Woody Biomass Density data set, created by the Woods Hole Research Center and Dan Zarin, expands on the methodology presented in Baccini et al. (2012)  to generate a pantropical map of aboveground live woody biomass density at 30 m resolution for the year 2000. The statistical relationship derived from ground-based measurements of forest biomass density and collocated Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR waveform metrics, as described by Baccini et al. (2012), was used to estimate the biomass density of more than 40,000 GLAS footprints throughout the tropics. Then, using Random Forest models, the GLAS-derived estimates of biomass density were correlated to continuous, gridded variables, including Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery and products (e.g., reflectance), elevation, and biophysical variables. By using continuous gridded data sets as inputs to the Random Forest models, a wall-to-wall 30 m resolution map of aboveground woody biomass density across the tropics was produced. Biomass density values are shown on the map; carbon density values can be estimated as 50% of biomass density values. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The map will provide accurate estimates of aboveground carbon stock and aboveground carbon density when aggregated to large areas (5,000 to 10,000 ha) for project- and regional-level assessments. The biomass density value of a single pixel may have large uncertainty when compared with small plots for verification.

description: The European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC JRC) and Columbia University Earth Institute Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) created a 250-meter resolution population grid. Residential population estimates for 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2015 were disaggregated from census or administrative units to grid cells, informed by the distribution and density of built-up as mapped in the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) global layer per corresponding epoch.   To produce the new population grids, a simple model was developed and implemented. The approach was based on arster-based dasymetric mapping relying on GHS-BUILT as a proxy to restrict and refine the distribution of people and inform on the respective density.  The built-up grid is the distribution of built-up areas expressed as their proportion of occupied footprint in each cell. Population estimates consisted of country-based layers of census and administrative polygons containing estimated residential population for target years. For each period, population grids were produced following a clear volume-preserving dasymetric mapping approach: given a consensus layer and a GHSL BU raster layer, for a populated polygon (source zone), (a) if the polygon generates 250 m cells and contains built-up (BU) area, disaggregate the population in proportion to density of BU; (b) if the polygon generates 250 m cells and does not contain BU, disaggregate population using areal weighting; (c) if the polygon does not generate its own 250 m cell, convert polygon to point (centroid within), sum all points within a cell, and sum to a mosaic of (a) and (b). Option (c) was required because some populated source zones (polygons) were smaller than a 250 x 250 m cell. This model preserved the full resolution of the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) input population units and conserved the total input population. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: For 1975, greater uncertainties in estimating small-scale populations farther from the census year combine with larger difficulties in mapping built-up (from lower-resolution Landsat MSS sensor) to make this surface less reliable. A consequence of C-points is the allocation of population from these (typically small) polygons to only one cell, and occasionally a slight displacement of population to neighboring 250 m cells. Quality control was conducted to ensure that all input population was disaggregated and totals were preserved.

MapSPAM uses a 4-step modeling process: 1) Start with administrative units for which crop production statistics are available.  2) Obtain a classified land-cover image with cropland identified. 3) Integrate crop-specific suitability information from the FAO Global Agro-ecological Zones (GAEZ). 4) Employ a cross-entropy approach to obtain estimates of crop distribution among viable crop areas. Data on administrative units and crop production come largely from the Mapping of Agricultural Production Systems (Agro-MAPS) project, World Food Programme (WFP) crop and food supply assessment mission surveys, national bureaus of statistics and other government ministries, regional agricultural centers and NGOs, and water resource groups, among others. Crop production systems are differentiated into 4 technologies: irrigated high inputs production (I), rain-fed high inputs production (H), rain-fed low inputs production (L), and rain-fed subsistence production (S). Data are also provided by a total for all technologies (A) and totals for all rain-fed technologies (R). These production system definitions are modeled after the FAO GAEZ. The proportion of crop areas using irrigated high input production are taken directly from country statistics for China, the United States, and Brazil; other countries' data are drawn from the monthly irrigated and rain-fed crop areas (MIRCA) and FAO AQUASTAT irrigated areas databases. The extent of crop growing areas is derived from a compilation of satellite imagery from various sources, as well as detailed crop distribution maps at 5 arc minute scale where they are available. An allocation optimization algorithm is used to find the distribution of crops that is most likely, given all the available crop production and price statistics, and maps of crop area, irrigation infrastructure, and agro-ecological crop suitability. This optimization model is written and solved using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Not all crops in the data set are represented in the FAO GAEZ crop suitability data. In these occurrences, data from a similar crop in a given area were used to indicate attainable crop yields and suitable production areas. The statistical optimization methods used in the cross-entropy model produce estimates of the "most likely" crop distribution scenario. These may not accurately reflect the reality of production systems at 5 arc minute resolution. Only estimations of global crop harvested area and production for maize, wheat, rice and soybean are displayed.

This series of digital world maps for the period of 1901-2100 depicts global trends in observed climate and projected climate change scenarios with 0.5 degree spatial resolution. World maps for the observational period 1901-2002 are based on recent data sets from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia and the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) at the German Weather Service. World maps for the period 2003-2100 are based on ensemble projections of global climate models provided by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and can be found on the original site. The main results comprise an estimation of the shifts of climate zones in the 21st century by considering different IPCC scenarios. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: This global erosion layer, created by researchers at WRI, shows the risk of erosion around the world, from low to high, calculated from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). This predicts annual soil loss risk from rainfall and runoff and is the most common model used at large spatial scales due to its relatively simple structure and empirical basis. The model takes into account rainfall erosivity, topography, soil erodibility, land cover and management, and conservation practices. Because the RUSLE model was developed based on agricultural plot scale and parameterized for environmental conditions in the United States, modifications of the methods and data inputs are necessary to make the equation applicable to the rest of the globe. The result of the global model was categorized into 5 quantiles, corresponding to low to high erosion risks. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The RUSLE model was originally developed to be applicable on the agriculture plot scale and was parameterized for environmental conditions in the United States. The application of the model on a global scale may contain uncertainly and overestimation compared to available observed data, especially for tropical regions, polar climate zones, and high mountainous regions. Adjustments to the model (see below) have improved its global applicability, especially for mountainous regions, but they do not eliminate the model's bias and uncertainty. The accuracy of this layer has not been assessed. The model does not account for sediment deposition or sediment transport.

description: The global human footprint map, created by Venter et al. (2016), used the human footprint framework to compile remotely sensed and bottom-up survey information on 8 variables measuring the direct and indirect human pressures on the environment in 1993 and 2009. The study included data on (1) extent of built environments, (2) crop land, (3) pasture land, (4) human population density, (5) nighttime lights, (6) railways, (7) roads, and (8) navigable waterways. These pressures were weighted according to estimates of their relative levels of human pressure and then summed together to create the standardized human footprint for all non-Antarctic land areas at 1 km resolution. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Only the 2009 data layer is visible on Resource Watch.  The study did not fully account for all human pressures, and a lack of available data resulted in 3 of their pressures being static through time, which would cause an underestimation of human footprint expansion if these pressures expanded at a higher than average rate. Also, the human footprint measures the pressure humans place on nature, not the realized state or impacts on natural systems or their biodiversity. Significant scope exists to determine how natural systems respond to cumulating human pressures, and if nonlinearity or thresholds exist where pressures lead to accelerated impacts.

description: Global Gridded Geographically Based Economic Data (G-Econ), Version 4 provides a measure of global cell product (GCP): estimates for the amount of gross domestic product (GDP) produced in each grid cell of a 1-degree grid of the world using 2 metrics: GCP measured in the market exchange rate (MER) from local currencies into USD, and GCP measured in purchasing power parity (PPP), which adjusts country currency GCP according to the equivalent amount of USD needed to purchase a standardized collection of goods in the country using the country's currency. GCP is defined as the gross value added by activities in a grid cell. Gross value is calculated as the total value of the outputs of local businesses providing goods and services in the grid cell, minus the value of inputs bought by those businesses. The data and methods used to calculate local added value are different for different countries, as the data available are different for different countries. State- and county level gross value data are used whenever possible. A full discussion of the methods used to calculate GCP is available here: https://gecon.yale.edu/data-and-documentation-g-econ-project. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Subnational data describing gross output are of higher quality in countries that have high incomes and are in periods of peace and conversely of lower quality in low-income countries or those that are experiencing war or revolution. This variable quality of underlying data effects the reliability of GCP calculations.    A proportional allocation technique is applied to spatially rescale data reported at a county or state level to the 1 degree grid used to report GCP. This includes a measure of assumption that may result in unrealistic allocations. This is often referred to as the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP), a well-recognized challenge when attempting to make statements regarding the spatial distribution of a variable within the smallest geographic unit at which that variable was reported. The Yale team experimented with various spatial rescaling techniques and decided that the proportional allocation method produced results that were most reasonable.

description: The Commercial Shipping Lanes data set was created by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) as part of the Global Map of Human Impacts on Marine Ecosystems and is distributed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as part of its Science on a Sphere initiative. These data can be used to estimate areas exposed to high levels of shipping traffic, which can be disruptive to the environment through noise pollution, ballast water expulsion, or fuel pollution, among other impacts. The Commercial Shipping Lanes are constructed using data from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). ICOADS is a voluntary ocean observation data set. Ships participating with ICOADS opt to carry monitoring equipment and periodically report measurements on their location and environmental variables such as sea surface temperature, wind direction, and speed. From October 2004 through October of 2005 1,189,127 mobile ship data points were collected from 3,374 commercial and research vessels, which is about 11% of all ships at sea in 2005.These position recordings were connected to form shipping lanes in all oceans. Any lines that crossed land masses were discarded. The resulting lines were given a 0.5 km buffer on either side to account for the width of shipping lanes. These polygons were then superimposed over a 1 km raster grid and summed to provide a measure of total ship traffic through each grid cell of the ocean surface. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The ships that participate in the voluntary tracking scheme only make up 11% of the global shipping fleet. Selection bias may affect the representativeness of these ships' movements for drawing conclusions about traffic of the entire shipping fleet. The data used to generate these rasters of shipping intensity span from October 2004 to October 2005. The trade patterns of that year's time may not be representative of current or future trade.

description: This data set, a collaboration between the GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) lab at the University of Maryland, Google, USGS, and NASA, measures areas of tree cover gain across all global land (except Antarctica and other Arctic islands) at 30 × 30 meter resolution, displayed as a 12-year cumulative layer. The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+) sensor. Over 600,000 Landsat 7 images were compiled and analyzed using Google Earth Engine, a cloud platform for earth observation and data analysis. The clear land surface observations (30 × 30 meter pixels) in the satellite images were assembled and a supervised learning algorithm was then applied to identify per pixel tree cover gain. Tree cover gain was defined as the establishment of tree canopy at the Landsat pixel scale in an area that previously had no tree cover. Tree cover gain may indicate a number of potential activities, including natural forest growth or the crop rotation cycle of tree plantations.  The tree cover canopy density of the displayed data is >50%. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: In this data set, “tree cover” is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. “Gain” is defined as the establishment of tree canopy at the Landsat pixel scale in an area that previously had no tree cover. Tree cover gain may indicate a number of potential activities, including natural forest growth or the crop rotation cycle of tree plantations. Due to variation in research methodology and date of content, tree cover, loss, and gain data sets cannot be compared accurately against each other. Accordingly, “net” loss cannot be calculated by subtracting figures for tree cover gain from tree cover loss, and current (post-2000) tree cover cannot be determined by subtracting figures for annual tree cover loss from year 2000 tree cover. The authors evaluated the overall prevalence of false positives (commission errors) in this data at 24%, and the prevalence of false negatives (omission errors) at 26%, though the accuracy varies by biome and thus may be higher or lower in any particular location.

description: This data set, a collaboration between the GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) lab at the University of Maryland, Google, USGS, and NASA, measures areas of tree cover loss across all global land (except Antarctica and other Arctic islands) at approximately 30 × 30 meter resolution. The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM), the Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. Over 1 million satellite images were processed and analyzed, including over 600,000 Landsat 7 images for the 2000-2012 interval, and more than 400,000 Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images for updates for the 2011-2016 interval. The clear land surface observations in the satellite images were assembled and a supervised learning algorithm was applied to identify per pixel tree cover loss. In this data set, “tree cover” is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. Tree cover loss is defined as “stand replacement disturbance,” or the complete removal of tree cover canopy at the Landsat pixel scale. Tree cover loss may be the result of human activities, including forestry practices such as timber harvesting or deforestation (the conversion of natural forest to other land uses), as well as natural causes such as disease or storm damage. Fire is another widespread cause of tree cover loss, and can be either natural or human-induced. This data set has been updated four times since its creation, and now includes loss up to 2016 (Version 1.4). The analysis method has been modified in numerous ways, including new data for the target year, re-processed data for previous years (2011 and 2012 for the Version 1.1 update, 2012 and 2013 for the Version 1.2 update, and 2014 for the Version 1.3 update), and improved modelling and calibration. These modifications improve change detection for 2011-2016, including better detection of boreal loss due to fire, smallholder rotation agriculture in tropical forests, selective losing, and short cycle plantations. Eventually, a future “Version 2.0” will include reprocessing for 2000-2010 data, but in the meantime integrated use of the original data and Version 1.4 should be performed with caution.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: In this data set, “tree cover” is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. “Loss” indicates the removal or mortality of tree cover and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, “loss” does not equate to deforestation. Due to variation in research methodology and date of content, tree cover, loss, and gain data sets cannot be compared accurately against each other. Accordingly, “net” loss cannot be calculated by subtracting figures for tree cover gain from tree cover loss, and current (post-2000) tree cover cannot be determined by subtracting figures for annual tree cover loss from year 2000 tree cover. The 2011-2016 data was produced using updated methodology. Comparisons between the original 2001-2010 data and the 2011-2016 update should be performed with caution. The authors evaluated the overall prevalence of false positives (commission errors) in this data at 13%, and the prevalence of false negatives (omission errors) at 12%, though the accuracy varies by biome and thus may be higher or lower in any particular location. The model often misses disturbances in smallholder landscapes, resulting in lower accuracy of the data in sub-Saharan Africa, where this type of disturbance is more common. The authors are 75 percent confident that the loss occurred within the stated year, and 97 percent confident that it occurred within a year before or after. Users of the data can smooth out such uncertainty by examining the average over multiple years.

description: The Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment–Global Nutrient Model (IMAGE–GNM) is a global distributed, spatially explicit model using hydrology as the basis for describing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) delivery to surface water, transport and in-stream retention in rivers, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs. It is part of the integrated assessment model IMAGE, which studies the interaction between society and the environment over prolonged time periods. In the IMAGE–GNM model, grid cells receive water with dissolved and suspended N and P from upstream grid cells; inside grid cells, N and P are delivered to water bodies via diffuse sources (surface runoff, shallow and deep groundwater, riparian zones; litterfall in floodplains; atmospheric deposition) and point sources (wastewater); N and P retention in a water body is calculated on the basis of the residence time of the water and nutrient uptake velocity; subsequently, water and nutrients are transported to downstream grid cells. Differences between model results and observed concentrations for a range of global rivers are acceptable given the global scale of the uncalibrated model. Sensitivity analysis with data for the year 2000 showed that runoff is a major factor for N and P delivery, retention and river export. For both N and P, uptake velocity and all factors used to compute the subgrid in-stream retention are important for total in-stream retention and river export. Soil N budgets, wastewater and all factors determining litterfall in floodplains are important for N delivery to surface water. For P the factors that determine the P content of the soil (soil P content and bulk density) are important factors for delivery and river export. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Many components and data are ignored in this discussion, including all the data stemming from the IMAGE on soils, lithology, land use, vegetation distribution, nutrient cycles in agriculture and natural ecosystems, and climate. PBL acknowledges that updates of the data used in this paper are now available.

description: Potential Natural Vegetation is a data set created by EarthStat to identify what vegetation would be most likely to exist now in the absence of human activities. In regions not dominated by human land use, the vegetation types are those currently observed from a satellite. This differs from presettlement natural vegetation to the extent that vegetation types have changed because of changing environmental conditions such as climate and CO₂ concentrations.   1 km resolution DISCover data were classified under the Olson Global Ecosystems (OGE) framework to derive the potential vegetation data set. First the 94 OGE classes were reclassified into 15 potential vegetation types and 3 additional classes: land use, wetlands, and water. Wetlands are poorly characterized in the DISCover data and were thus ignored; only upland natural vegetation was considered. Each 5-minute resolution grid cell was searched among the 1 km pixels for the dominant potential upland vegetation class and was assigned to be the potential vegetation. Some grid cells had 2 dominant potential vegetation classes, or none. In these cases the search was iterated to the adjacent 1 km pixels until a dominant potential vegetation class was found.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The potential natural vegetation is averaged over 5 minute resolution grid cells and should be used with caution at a finer scale.

description: The Areas Vulnerable to Coastal Flooding & Sea Level Rise data set is prepared by Climate Central. This layers are relative to local high tide lines (Mean Higher High Water, or MHHW). Map areas below the selected water level are displayed in blue indicating vulnerability to flooding from combined sea level rise, storm surge, and tides, or to permanent submergence by long-term sea level rise.  Elevation data used for parts of this map within the U.S. come almost entirely from ~5-meter horizontal resolution digital elevation models curated and distributed by NOAA in its Coastal Lidar collection, derived from high-accuracy laser-rangefinding measurements.  Areas outside the U.S. use elevation data on a roughly 90-meter horizontal resolution grid derived from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM).  Local high tide level is determined using two data sources as well: the VDatum tidal model for the contiguous United States, and a global tidal model supplied by Mark Merrifield of the University of Hawaii for the rest of the world.
cautions: SRTM provides surface, rather than bare-earth, elevations, causing it to commonly overestimate elevation, especially in areas with dense and tall buildings or vegetation. While SRTM contains contains significant error in both directions, depending on location, the map more often  under-portrays areas that could be submerged at each water level, and exposure is usually greater than shown (Kulp and Strauss, 2016).   SRTM does not cover latitudes above  60 degrees north or below 56 degrees south, meaning that sparsely populated parts of Arctic Circle nations are not assessed here.  Areas of this map in Alaska use elevation data on a roughly 60-meter horizontal resolution grid supplied by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). This data is referenced to a vertical reference frame from 1929, based on historic sea levels, and with no established conversion to modern reference frames. The data also do not take into account subsequent land uplift and subsidence, widespread in the state. As a consequence, low confidence should be placed in Alaska map portions.  This data set does not indicate where certain areas of low-elevation land are protected from sea level rise by local topographical features, such as being surrounded by higher land which will not allow rising seas to seep through. Similarly, this data does not indicate whether an area of land is protected from sea level rise through built infrastructural mitigations such as levees, seawalls, or other structures.  Analysis does not consider erosion, marsh migration, porous bedrock geology, channels, holes, or passages for drainage, or other connectivity features not revealed in the elevation data.
functions: Identify areas vulnerable to flooding at a number of different water heights, potentially caused in the near- and long- term by a combination of sea level rise, storm surge, tides, or tsunamis.

description: The Global Human Settlements Grid (GHS), produced by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC JRC), highlights areas with a dense population and a high degree of built-up land. It assesses the REGIO-OECD “degree of urbanization” model using as input the population grid cells in 4 epochs (2015, 2000, 1990, and 1975). Each square kilometer grid cell has been generated by integration of built-up areas produced from Landsat image, and population data derived from the Center for International Earth Science Information Network Gridded Population of the World, version 4 (CIESIN GPW v4). These data are divided into three discrete categories: urban centers, urban cluster, and rural areas. Urban centers, or high density clusters, are defined as “contiguous cells (4-connectivity, gap filling) with a density of at least 1,500 inhabitants/km² or a density of built-up greater than 50%, and a minimum of 50,000 inhabitants” per cluster. Urban clusters, are lower-density clusters including towns and suburbs, defined as contiguous grid cells with a population of at least 300 inhabitants per km² or a density of built-up greater than 50% and a minimum of 5,000 inhabitants. Rural areas are defined as grid cells outside high-density clusters and urban clusters.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: This data set is an analytical product based on satellite imagery and users should use caution.

description: The Cropland and Pasture Area in 2000 data set, created by EarthStat, University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment (UMN IonE) and the Land Use and Global Environment Lab at the University of British Columbia (LUGE Lab at UBC), was created to understand the extent and spatial distribution of agricultural activities. This data set was created by combining agricultural inventory data and satellite-derived land cover data. The agricultural inventory data was used to train a land cover classification data set obtained by merging two different satellite-derived products: Boston University's MODIS-derived land cover product, and the GLC2000 data set. A set of climatic parameters were set to mask obviously non-agriculture areas, such as open shrubland in boreal Canada, within the satellite data. Protected/minimal use areas in central Australia were also masked, which otherwise got classified as pasture. The Cropland and pasture area data is global and is presented at 5-minute spatial resolution. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: This data set is calculated based on agricultural inventory data and satellite-derived land cover data and should be used with caution when making decisions based on the data.

description: The Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) supported the development of the Global- Potential Evapo-Transpiration (PET) Database. This database is designed for use in models of sustainable development, biodiversity and environmental conservation, poverty alleviation, and adaption to climate change globally, particularly in developing countries, and provides data for each month between 1950 and 2000 at a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds. Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) is a measure of the rate at which water evaporates from the Earth's surface into the atmosphere, measured in this database by millimeters of water evaporated per month. It is influenced by several factors, including solar radiation, temperature, air humidity, and wind speed. Other contributing factors include the leaf area index of an area, as water pooling on top of leaves and tree canopies can lead to faster evaporation than if precipitating water entered the soil layer. The Food and Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) equation incorporates these factors into a calculation of PET that is widely considered to be the best estimate of actual PET available: PET = 0.0023 * RA * (Tmean + 17.8) * TD^(0.5) where RA represents extra-terrestrial radiation in millimeters per month, Tmean is the mean temperature in degrees Celsius, and TD is the daily temperature range in degrees Celsius. These variables are not always available at every point on Earth, which prevents calculation with the FAO-PM. This Global-PET database is calculated using a simpler equation attributed to Hargreave, which requires monthly average data sets of mean temperatures, daily temperature range, and extraterrestrial radiation. These variables are all available in the WorldClim Global Climate Data database. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Hargreave's method of calculating PET requires less specific data than the more widely used FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) method and was shown to be inferior to the FAO-PM method in a validation exercise, but it is used here to provide an alternate method in case the full data required to calculate the FAO-PM PET are unavailable.

description: The Global Volcano Hazard Frequency and Distribution data are created by the World Bank Group (WBG), Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (Columbia CHRR), and Columbia University Earth Institute Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). The data are released in a 2.5-minute gridded data set based on the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) Volcano Database spanning the period 1979 through 2000. This database includes nearly 4,000 volcanic events categorized as moderate or above (values 2 through 8) according to the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI). Most volcanoes are georeferenced to the nearest tenth or hundredth of a degree with a few to the nearest thousandth of a degree. To produce the final output, the frequency of a volcanic hazard is computed for each grid cell, with the data set consequently being classified into deciles (10 bins, each with an approximately equal number of grid cells). The higher the grid cell value in the final output, the higher the relative frequency of hazard posed by volcanoes. This data set is the result of collaboration between the CHRR and CIESIN. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Areas of "No Data" are not necessarily without risk from hazards but may rather be an artifact of a mask that excluded from analysis those areas with a population density less than 5 persons per square kilometer and without significant agriculture.

description: The "Terrestrial Protected Areas (% of Total Land Area)" data set was published on the World Bank's open access data portal. It was created using data from the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre and compiled by the World Resources Institute. Terrestrial protected areas are defined in this instance as "totally or partially protected areas of at least 1,000 hectares that are designated by national authorities as scientific reserves with limited public access, national parks, natural monuments, nature reserves or wildlife sanctuaries, protected landscapes, and areas managed mainly for sustainable use." Marine areas, unclassified areas, littoral (intertidal) areas, and sites protected under local or provincial law are excluded. Some sites are owned and managed by governments, others by private individuals, companies, communities, and faith groups. Currently about a 10th of the world's land surface is under some form of protected area, and the system represents a unique commitment to the future. Over the last 40 years the global protected area estate has increased from an area the size of the United Kingdom to an area the size of South America. Increasing the proportion of terrestrial and marine areas protected helps defend vulnerable plant and animal species and safeguard biodiversity.   This indicator is calculated using all the nationally designated protected areas recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) whose location and extent is known and aggregated using a weighted average. A global protected area layer is created by combining the polygons and points recorded in the WDPA. Circular buffers are created around points based on the known extent of protected areas for which no polygon is available. Annual protected area layers are created by dissolving the global protected area layer by the known year of establishment of protected areas recorded in the WDPA. The annual protected area layers are overlaid with country/territory boundaries, coastlines, and buffered coastlines (delineating the territorial waters) to obtain the absolute coverage (in square kilometers) of protected areas by country/territory per year from 1990 to present. The total area of a country's/territory's terrestrial protected areas and marine protected areas in territorial waters is divided by the total area of its land areas (including inland waters) and territorial waters to obtain the relative coverage (percentage) of protected areas. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Designation as a protected area is not an indication of how effectively the area is being managed and does not designate the type of protections the area is receiving (e.g., protected area categories defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature [IUCN]). There are also data/knowledge gaps for some countries due to difficulties in reporting national protected area data to the WDPA and/or determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area. Protected areas with unknown location and/or extent were excluded from the GIS analysis.

description: The Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover (LC) project of the European Space Agency (ESA) delivers consistent global LC maps at 300 m spatial resolution on an annual basis from 1992 to 2015. Each pixel value corresponds to the label of a land cover class defined based on the UN Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). This unique dataset was produced thanks to the reprocessing and the interpretation of 5 different satellite missions.Baseline LC maps are generated thanks to the entire MERIS FR and RR archive from 2003 to 2012. Independently from this baseline, LC changes are detected at 1 km based on the AVHRR time series between 1992 to 1999, SPOT-VGT time series between 1999 and 2013, and PROBA-V data for years 2013, 2014, and 2015. When MERIS FR or PROBA-V time series are available, changes detected at 1 km are remapped at 300 m. The last step consists in back- and updating the 10-year baseline LC map to produce the 24 annual LC maps from 1992 to 2015. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The quality of the map varies according to the region of interest and to the thematic class. Given the methodology to detect the change, it is of paramount importance to highlight that the CCI-LC data set does not capture all the possible changes between the 22 LCCS land cover classes. Abrupt changes are better captured than gradual ones. To allow the detection of a change from a class X to a class Y, the developed method needs to observe the new class Y during at least 2 consecutive years. All annual CCI-LC maps are delivered at 300 m spatial resolution, but it is should be recalled that the change detection is performed at 1 km spatial resolution, based on the AVHRR, SPOT-VGT, and PROBA-V missions. This means that only land cover changes visible at 1 km are detected. Changes along the coastlines and of permanent snow and ice class are not included in the CCI-LC products. Changes along the coastlines are not captured with a change detection algorithm based on 1 km observations. An exception is made, however, for changes related to the Saudi Arabia manmade islands. In addition, the permanent snow and ice (class value 220) remains constant over time and relies solely on the Randolph Glaciers Inventory. Changes occurring in the 2014-2015 period are limited to forest changes. This is a consequence of the methodology that needs to have confirmation of the land cover change for at least 2 years. During this period, this confirmation cannot be ensured, and so only the forest changes (which are the easiest to detect) are included in the maps. In addition, the lack of AVHRR data in year 1994 reduces the change detection reliability for this particular year.

description: The Global Biodiversity Index from Newbold et al. at ~1 km resolution shows global estimates of how land use pressures have affected the numbers of species and individuals found in samples from local terrestrial ecological assemblages. The map represents the average losses of originally present species. Using 2,382,624 records of data from the Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems (PREDICTS) database, a global database of how local terrestrial biodiversity responds to human impacts, the map models how sampled richness and abundance respond to land use pressures. The models also include 4 pressure variables—land use, land use intensity, human population density, and proximity to the nearest road. Values of the response variables are always expressed relative to an intact assemblage undisturbed by humans and therefore do not rely on estimates of absolute abundance or species richness, which vary widely among biomes and taxa. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The models suggest a generally smaller impact of land use on the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) than that in a previous study and may have overestimated the BII by ignoring lagged responses and using sites that often have experienced some human impact as baselines. The density of sampling is inevitably uneven; biomes that are particularly underrepresented, relative to their global ecosystem productivity, include boreal forests, tundra, flooded grasslands, and savannas and mangroves, meaning that less confidence can be placed in the results for these biomes. The data probably also underrepresent soil and canopy species.

description: This geospatial crop database was created by EarthStat, University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment and the Land Use (UMN IonE) and Global Environment Lab at the University of British Columbia (LUGE Lab at UBC). It covers the period between 1961 and 2008 annually, and tracks maize, rice, wheat, and soybean performance across about 13,500 political units. These data were further quality controlled, standardized, and converted into yield information at 3 variable spatial levels based on data availability: national, state, and county/district/municípios/departments, and geographic units. Data availability varied among regions. Missing data values were more common in the early years of the data set. Average values from a 5-year window were then used to interpolate missing subnational data, constrained by values from the political unit within which the data were nested. EarthStat linearly regressed 20 years of crop yields at each of the political units to determine the average linear rates of yield improvement over the observed period. Yield trends were analyzed by parsimoniously choosing among regression models of increasing order at each political unit for each crop: an intercept-only model, a linear model, a quadratic model, and a cubic model. EarthStat used the Akaike Information Criterion to decide which model best fit the observed data. Next, F-tests were conducted at each political unit to determine the quality of the model fit against the null hypothesis of a constant model. Population data and their projections per country were from the UN medium variant projections. Crop production was determined using the projected crop yields at current observed rates of yield change and harvested areas fixed at ~2007. Per capita harvested production is the ratio of production to population, and a greater than ±10% change from ~2007 is considered significant either in the short (2025) or long term (2050). Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: These data do not contain unique data for each grid cell as they are aggregated based on administrative unit reporting. These data are compiled using information gathered from individual countries' agricultural censuses. These data may be accurate to country level, admin1 level, or admin2 level. Data quality may be poor in some countries and years where complete or true information is lacking because of political strife, weak institutions, incentives to misreport data, lack of access to proprietary data, and so on.

The data are available in 30 arc second (~1 km) resolutions. The grid cell values represent the total number of species in a particular class, family, or IUCN threatened category. The input vector layers are based on the IUCN Red List, and the grids are compiled by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network. The data from IUCN were downloaded in April 2013.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The data was transformed from shapefiles into geotiffs, and species were excluded from the database for which only isolated records (point files) existed or if they are considered extinct in the wild.

description: This data set was published in the Human Development Report 2016: Development for Everyone (page 218) by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and lists the following poverty statistics for developing countries: Multidimensional Poverty Index, Population in Multidimensional Poverty, Population near Multidimensional Poverty, Population in Severe Multidimensional Poverty, Contribution of Deprivation in Dimension to Overall Poverty, and Population Living below Income Poverty Line (both the national poverty line and purchasing power parity [PPP] of $1.90/day). The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is calculated using metrics on nutrition and child mortality, education (years of schooling, headcount ratio, children enrolled), intensity of poverty, and standard of living (cooking fuel, sanitation, electricity, floor assets). The multidimensional poverty headcount is determined by the percent of the population (or thousands of the population in the survey year) with a deprivation score of at least 33%. The percentage of the population with a score between 20 and 33% are "near" multidimensional poverty, and those in "severe" multidimensional poverty have a deprivation score of 50% or more. The contribution of deprivation is the percentage of the MPI attributed to deprivations in each dimension. The population living below the poverty line is the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line (the poverty line deemed appropriate for the country by its authorities, based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys) and the percentage of the population living on less than $1.90 in terms of PPP. The data on the percentage of the population below the national and $1.90 poverty lines were obtained from the World Bank's World Development Indicators Database.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: The Populations of Concern database contains data about the UNHCR's populations of concern from the year 1951 up to 2016. It provides information on the people’s country of residence or origin and their status. The UNHCR's populations of concern include the following:  1. Refugees who include individuals recognized under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees; its 1967 protocol; the 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa; those recognized in accordance with the UNHCR statute; individuals granted complementary forms of protection; or those enjoying temporary protection. Since 2007, the refugee population also includes people in a refugee-like situation.   2. Asylum-seekers who are individuals who have sought international protection and whose claims for refugee status have not yet been determined, irrespective of when they may have been lodged.   3. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) who are people or groups of individuals forced to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of, or in order to avoid the effects of, armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights, or natural or man-made disasters, and who have not crossed an international border. For the purposes of the UNHCR's statistics, this population only includes conflict-generated IDPs to whom the UNHCR extends protection and/or assistance. Since 2007, the IDP population also includes people in an IDP-like situation. For global IDP estimates, see www.internal-displacement.org.   4. Returned refugees who are former refugees who have returned to their country of origin spontaneously or in an organized fashion but are yet to be fully integrated. Such return would normally only take place in conditions of safety and dignity.   5. Returned IDPs who are those IDPs who were beneficiaries of the UNHCR's protection and assistance activities and who returned to their areas of origin or habitual residence during the year.   6. Stateless persons who are defined under international law as persons not considered as nationals by any state under the operation of its law. In other words, they do not possess the nationality of any state. UNHCR statistics refer to persons who fall under the agency’s statelessness mandate because they are stateless according to this international definition, but data from some countries may also include persons with undetermined nationality.   7. Others of concern refers to individuals who do not necessarily fall directly into any of the groups above, but to whom the UNHCR extends its protection and/or assistance services, based on humanitarian or other special grounds. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.

description: Vaisala created this global data set of average annual global horizontal irradiance (GHI, the key variable for photovoltaic [PV] projects, measured in W/m²) at a 2 arc minute resolution. Solar energy investors and project developers can use these data to identify regions of the world likely to have sufficient solar resources to make a solar generation facility a worthwhile investment. Vaisala is an industry leader in the solar resource assessment space. It has been at the forefront of research regarding the estimation of surface solar conditions to better understand and predict solar energy generation. In 2010, Vaisala produced the world's first high-resolution, globally consistent data set mapping the world's solar resource potential. The annual average GHI information from this data set is provided here at a 2 arc minute resolution and based on over a decade of half-hourly, high-resolution visible satellite imagery via the broadband visible wavelength channel. The values have been processed using a combination of peer-reviewed, industry-standard techniques and in-house, including a cloud-index algorithm that produces consistent results when used with the large number of satellites that must be combined to construct a global data set. Vaisala's complete global solar database includes 2 decades of hourly estimates of GHI, direct normal irradiance (DNI), and diffuse irradiance (DIF) and is regularly maintained and updated across 5 different versions of the data set. GHI is most relevant for fixed-panel PV installations, and DNI is most relevant for concentrated solar power (CSP) projects and PV tracking systems. This data set can be used for rapid prospecting for solar energy generation sites or conducting national or regional infrastructure, policy, or transmission planning. However, the development of specific utility-scale projects generally requires additional site-specific research after this step. The global solar data set is intended as a tool to help to narrow the focus of project developers and investors to accelerate the growth of solar energy worldwide. The data set has been validated against nearly 200 publicly available ground stations around the world. For more information, please visit http://www.vaisala.com/Vaisala%20Documents/Scientific%20papers/3TIER%20Solar%20Dataset%20Methodology%20and%20Validation.pdf. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: This data set does not account for local shadows or shade, and site conditions must be checked to better interpret the provided irradiance values. The satellite algorithm used to generate data also will not perform well in areas where there is highly reflective terrain (i.e., salt flat or areas with permanent snow). The average annual values from this data set are not meant to replace more rigorous site-specific studies of solar energy potential, and they should be followed by more rigorous and reliable evaluation. Data are intended for high-level prospecting and for use in national or regional infrastructure, transmission, or policy planning.

description: The Global Human Settlement (GHS) Built-Up Grid data sets are produced by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. These data sets display multitemporal information layers on built-up presence (i.e., urbanized areas containing man-made structures) at 1km resolution as derived from Landsat image collections (GLS 1975, GLS 1990, GLS 2000, and ad hoc Landsat 8 collection 2013/2014). These data sets on built-up areas are available for 4 epochs at 15-year intervals: 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2015. The data have been produced by means of Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) methodology in 2015. More than 12.4k billion individual image data records have been collected by different satellite sensors in the past 40 years and are classified and automatically selected if they correspond to a built-up structure. The information is analyzed using the GHS built-up model, which utilizes spatial data mining technologies, and the availability of open and free image data input, to identify areas of the planet with high densities of built-up areas. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Landsat GHSL shows a tendency to saturate the information in built-up patches greater than circa 10 pixels (300 meters) as compared to reference topographic data. This phenomenon is probably linked to the fact that mainly radiometric criteria are used as input for the classification and consequently the detection is strongly linked to the materials of the urban fabric more than to their morphology or texture. Therefore, a relatively high confusion between built-up (rooftops) and roads or other sealed surfaces placed around the building can be expected in this product.

description: The Malaria Extent data set is provided by the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) and shows the estimated proportion of 2-10 year olds in the general population that are infected with P. falciparum at any one time on the African continent, where the disease is endemic. Malaria is a disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans by Anopheles mosquitoes. Two related parasite species cause the majority of disease and death from malaria: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. In areas affected by malaria, children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable, a condition further compounded by poverty. In Africa, where 80% of malaria cases are treated at home, the disease kills 1 child in 20 before the age of 5. MAP conducted surveys to collect data on malaria cases. Each survey included in the MAP parasite database has been disaggregated to individual sites (geographical points), individual dates (if the same site was sampled repeatedly), and individual parasite species. Conversely, individual-level survey data have been aggregated up to the community level at a particular site and time. MAP data spans 2000-2015. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: These data provide the first formal quantification, with rigorously defined uncertainty, of P. falciparum infection prevalence and disease incidence across sub-Saharan Africa from the year 2000 to the benchmark year of 2015, and of the role the major control interventions have had in causing these changes. Please note that any information derived from the MAP website is not an appropriate source for travel advice on malaria risk. Always consult a physician for the latest advice prior to travel.

description: Vaisala created this global data set of average annual wind speeds at 80m above the Earth's surface, a common height for wind turbines when the data set was originally created in 2008. The map resolution is 2 arc minutes and average wind speeds are measured in m/s. These data can be used to identify regions of the world likely to have sufficient wind resources to make wind energy generation a worthwhile investment. Vaisala pioneered the use of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models for producing realistic wind flows around the world to better understand and predict wind energy generation. NWP models are physically based and use powerful supercomputers to simulate the interaction between the entire atmosphere and the Earth's surface, even in places where no direct observations are available. This methodology captures the myriad processes responsible for wind---from jet-level dynamics to surface-level processes---and creates a more robust and accurate wind climatology. In essence, the models use numerical methods to obtain approximate answers to mathematical equations that describe the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere. To solve these equations for different locations on the globe, the atmosphere is divided into many small elements, both horizontally and vertically. The model computes what happens within each model element and how much mass, energy, and momentum is exchanged between the model elements. In 2008, with the release of its global wind data set, Vaisala was the first to map global wind potential at high resolution by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and conducting a 10-year computer simulation at a 2 arc minute (approximately 5 km) resolution. This data set can be used for rapid prospecting for wind energy generation sites or conducting national or regional infrastructure, policy, or transmission planning. However, the development of specific utility-scale projects requires additional site-specific research after this step. The global wind data set is intended as a tool to help to narrow the focus of project developers and investors to accelerate the growth of wind energy worldwide. The data set was validated against publicly available wind speed observations from more than 4,000 globally distributed meteorological stations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Automated Data Processing (ADP) surface observations data set. For more validation information, please visit http://www.vaisala.com/en/energy/Documents/WEA-ERG-3TIER-Global%20Wind%20Dataset.pdf. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Areas where there is considerable terrain roughness, such as hilly or coastal ones, are likely to exhibit variable wind speeds that may not be captured by the Vaisala simulation method. These data are not meant to replace more rigorous site-specific studies of wind energy potential, except for very small-scale projects for which a full wind energy potential study would not be worthwhile.

description: The Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) supported the development of the Global-Aridity Database. This database is designed for use in models of sustainable development, biodiversity and environmental conservation, poverty alleviation, and adaption to climate change globally, in particular in developing countries, and provides data for each month between 1950 and 2000 at a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds.    This dataset is the aridity index (AI), which is calculated as the ratio of mean annual precipitation to mean annual potential evapotranspiration (PET), using data from the WorldClim Global Climate Database. The yearly precipitation values are available directly from the WorldClim database, and the PET values are derived from a selection of WorldClim variables.    PET is a measure of the rate at which water evaporates from the Earth's surface into the atmosphere. It is influenced by several factors, including solar radiation, temperature, air humidity, and wind speed. Other contributing factors include the leaf area index of an area, as water pooling on top of leaves and tree canopies can lead to faster evaporation than if precipitating water entered the soil layer.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The global aridity values were multiplied by 10,000 to convert the decimal figures into integers. This makes the figures easier for computers to handle but distorts the units. The reported global aridity values should be multiplied by 0.0001 in order to retrieve the original units.    The PET estimates used to calculate the global aridity database are derived used Hargreave's method. Hargreave's method has been demonstrated to be inferior to the FAO Penman-Monteith method in a validation exercise, but it is used here to provide an alternate method in case the full data required to calculate the FAO-PM PET are unavailable.

description: The Annual Precipitation data set was adapted from the University of California, Berkeley's WorldClim V1 Bioclim, which produces bioclimatic variables derived from the monthly temperature and rainfall in order to generate more biologically meaningful values. The data product covers the period January 1, 1960, to December 31, 1990, and has global coverage at 1 km resolution. The bioclimatic variables represent annual trends (e.g., mean annual temperature, annual precipitation), seasonality (e.g., annual range in temperature and precipitation), and extreme or limiting environmental factors (e.g., temperature of the coldest and warmest month, and precipitation of the wettest and driest quarters). Climate data sets were created based on data from various sources, including the Global Historical Climate Network Dataset, the World Meteorological Organization's Climatological Normals (CLINO), the FAOCLIM 2.0 global climate database, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, and various regional climate databases. The data set contains the following bands: Annual Mean Temperature; Mean Diurnal Range; Isothermality; Temperature Seasonality; Max Temperature of Warmest Month; Min Temperature of Coldest Month; Temperature Annual Range; Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter; Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter; Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter; Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter; Annual Precipitation; Precipitation of Wettest Month (mm); Precipitation of Driest Month (mm); Precipitation Seasonality; Precipitation of Wettest Quarter (mm); Precipitation of Driest Quarter (mm); Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (mm); and Precipitation of Coldest Quarter (mm). This scheme follows that of ANUCLIM, except that for temperature seasonality the standard deviation was used because a coefficient of variation does not make sense with temperatures between -1 and 1.  Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The data on temperature and precipitation are obtained from weather stations around the world, but the accuracy and abundance of such weather stations are variable based on location. For example, there are few stations in areas with low population density such as the Arctic and Antarctica. The distribution of stations is related to a country’s levels of economic development, investments in meteorological observation networks, and national data access policies (e.g., climate data from the United States is generally more accessible than that of many other countries). Elevation bias in weather stations is related to latitude and the presence of mountains. In the tropics, stations tend to be biased toward higher elevations; elsewhere they are biased toward low elevations (particularly in the Himalayas and in parts of northwestern United States and Canada).

description: The Atlas of Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunities represents a first-ever global approximation of where degraded forest lands have the potential to be restored–opportunities to reduce poverty, improve food security, mitigate climate change, and protect the environment. The Atlas was produced by WRI in collaboration with the University of Maryland and IUCN as a contribution to the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration. The maps in the atlas are presented at a resolution of 1 km. The Atlas includes maps on current forest coverage, potential forest coverage, forest condition, restoration opportunities and human pressure. Data on forest condition and current land use were used to derive the map of opportunities for restoration on degraded lands. The land use data sets include population density, urbanized or industrial areas, and cropland distribution. Areas with high population density or those occupied by intensively managed croplands were considered as having no or low forest restoration potential. Areas with scattered cropland areas, pastures, agroforestry and all types of forest plantations were considered as providing promising opportunities for restoration. Restoration opportunity landscapes are distinguished with regard to the most likely type of restoration as follows: 1) wide-scale restoration aims to restore closed forests to the landscape. This type of restoration is more likely in deforested or degraded landscapes with low population density (< 10 people/km2) that are also areas where closed forests formerly dominated the landscape; 2) mosaic restoration integrates trees into mixed-use landscapes, such as agricultural lands and settlements, where trees can support people through improved water quality, increased soil fertility, and other ecosystem services. This type of restoration is more likely in deforested or degraded forest landscapes with moderate population density (10 - 100 people/km2); 3) Remote restoration is reserved for deforested or degraded forest lands that are completely unpopulated and located far away from human settlements, such as northern Canada and Siberia. The reduced density of forests in these areas is likely due to fire and pests, and their remoteness makes them a more costly and lower-priority restoration opportunity. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The atlas shows landscapes where restoration opportunities are more likely to be found, not the location of individual restoration sites. Many features of the landscape are not visible at the level of spatial resolution of the atlas (1 km), and local context could not be considered. No ground validation was conducted. The atlas shows the location of land with characteristics that indicate restoration opportunities, but it does not prescribe any particular type of restoration intervention. It is intended to inform the policy-making process at the global level and should be complemented by further investigation at regional and national scales, where more detailed information is needed and available.

description: The "Frequency of Future Coral Reef Bleaching Events in the 2030s and 2050s" data set was produced by the World Resources Institute (WRI). It depicts the frequency of future bleaching events in the 2030s and 2050s, as represented by the percentage of years in each decade where a NOAA Bleaching Alert Level 2 (i.e., severe thermal stress) is predicted to occur. These coral bleaching predictions are based on ocean temperature projections under an IPCC A1B (business-as-usual) emissions scenario and adjusted to account for historical temperature variability, but not adjusted by any other resistance or resilience factors. The thermal stress on corals is estimated using the accumulation of “degree heating months” (DHMs) over a 4-month rolling window at 50 km resolution. One DHM (in °C-month) is equal to 1 month of sea surface temperature that is 1°C greater than the maximum in the monthly climatology, known as the maximum monthly mean. The data used to produce this map were adapted from Donner, S.D. 2009 “Coping with Commitment: Projected thermal stress on coral reefs under different future scenarios.” Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: The data does not account for resistance or resilience factors apart from the historical temperature variability and shows projections for only 1 emissions scenario.

description: The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) created the Annual Nighttime Lights: Stable Composites from 1992 until 2013 at a 30 arc second grid resolution (approximately 1 km square grids). These composites account for where light has been observed throughout an entire year. Pixels are identified as being "stable lights" when light is detected there in more than 90-94% of valid observations. The long period of observation allows the product to include observations in places that are cloudy or otherwise obscured many days of the year. This data have been shown to be correlated with regional economic development.    The DMSP satellites fly in a sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (833 km mean altitude) such that they pass over any given point on Earth between 20:30 and 21:30 local time. With 14 orbits per day, each DMSP satellite provides global nighttime coverage every 24 hours. There are normally 2 satellites orbiting simultaneously, and each satellite has a lifespan of 6 to 8 years.     The light intensity is measured by sensors mounted on these satellites. The observations a satellite makes of a given pixel throughout the year will be from various heights and viewing angles. A mathematical procedure is used to average all of these observations to create the annual nighttime lights product. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
cautions: Radiances are measured on a 0 to 63 scale and are directly proportional to radiances in Watts per m². The satellite sensors used to create these images need to be periodically changed, as their sensitivity to light capture degrades over time. The images generated by this historical record come from sensors of varying ages and are not perfectly comparable. Gas flares and other temporary light sources may be captured by the annual composites. The effect of these light sources will be diminished in the percentage-modified DMSP-OLS night-light product. In areas of high brightness there is an observable blurring effect.

description: This tile layer of the world's hydrological features was created by ESRI and is designed to provide a hydrologically oriented set of features to use with the World Terrain Base Layer or other simple base maps. The map features a hydrocentric design based on the amount of water flowing within the drainage network such that symbols of the same size and color represent roughly the same amount of water. This map shows surface water flow as a linear phenomenon even over and through bodies of water. Using the best available, these data show relative flow accurately, so that if one river carries more water downstream than another river, the result will be that the river will have a thicker symbol on the map. This map is used as an overlay for content such as elevation from the World Terrain Base service or thematic services such as soil units, vegetation, or ecoregions. Combined with a basemap and map services, this map provides a frame of reference for showing regional, national, and continental hydrologic phenomena such as drought, runoff, river level monitoring and flood forecasting. River names are collected in the UTF8 character set so river names are collected in their original language but are written in the Roman alphabet. Sources for all river names are from the open source geonames.org project, so they are international by nature. The map is compiled from several sources. The global scales (very small scales through 1:2,300,000) include content from: HydroSHEDS, GTOPO30 Global Topographic Data, SRTM, GLWD, WorldClim, GRDC, and WWF Global 200 Terrestrial Eco Regions, with the latter three providing the inputs and basis for calculating flow. At medium scales (1:36,000 to 1:2,000,000) this service currently contains only U.S. data from the NHDPlusV2 that was jointly produced by the USGS and EPA. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, see the Learn More link.
